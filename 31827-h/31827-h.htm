<p><span class="smcap">While</span> preparing an account of <span class="smcap">Mount Etna</span> for the
Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica, I was surprised to find that
there exists no single work in the English language
devoted to the history of the most famous volcano in
the world. I was consequently induced to considerably
enlarge the Encyclop&aelig;dia article, and the following
pages are the result. The facts recorded have been
collected from various sources&mdash;German, French, Italian,
and English, and from my own observations made
during the summer of 1877. I desire to express my
indebtedness to Mr. Frank Rutley, of H.M. Geological
Survey, for his careful examination of the lavas which
were collected during my ascent of the mountain, and
for the account which he has written of them; also to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
Mr. John Murray for permission to copy figures from
Lyell's "Principles of Geology." My thanks are also
due to Mr. George Dennis, H.M. Consul-General in
Sicily; Mr. Robert O. Franck, Vice-Consul in Catania;
and to Prof. Orazio Silvestri, for information with which
they have severally supplied me.</p>

<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> principal mountain chain of Sicily skirts the
North and a portion of the North-eastern coast, and
would appear to be a prolongation of the Apennines.
An inferior group passes through the centre of the
island, diverging towards the South, as it approaches
the East coast. Between the two ranges, and completely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>separated from them by the valleys of the Alcantara
and the Simeto, stands the mighty mass of Mount Etna,
which rises in solitary grandeur from the eastern sea-board
of the island. Volcanoes, by the very mode of
their formation, are frequently completely isolated; and,
if they are of any magnitude, they thus acquire an
imposing contour and a majesty, which larger mountains,
forming parts of a chain, do not possess. This specially
applies to Etna. "C&oelig;lebs degit," says Cardinal Bembo,
"et nullius montis dignata conjugium, caste intra suos
terminos continetur." It is not alone the conspicuous
appearance of the mountain which has made it the
most famous volcano either of ancient or modern times:&mdash;the
number and violence of its eruptions, the extent
of its lava streams, its association with antiquity, and
its history prolonged over more than 2400 years, have
all tended to make it celebrated.</p>

<p>The geographical position of Etna was first accurately
determined by Captain Smyth in 1814. He estimated
the latitude of the highest point of the bifid peak of
the great crater at 37&deg; 43' 31" N.; and the longitude
at 15&deg; East of Greenwich. Elie de Beaumont repeated
the observations in 1834 with nearly the same result;
and these determinations have been very generally
adopted. In the new Italian map recently constructed
by the Stato Maggiore, the latitude of the centre of the
crater is stated to be 37&deg; 44' 55" N., and the longitude
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>44' 55" E. of the meridian of Naples, which passes
through the Observatory of Capo di Monte.</p>

<p>According to Bochart the name of Etna is derived from
the Ph&oelig;nician <i>athana</i>&mdash;a furnace; others derive it from
<span title="aith&ocirc;">&alpha;&iota;&prime;&theta;&omega;</span>&mdash;to burn. Professor Benfey of Gottingen, a great
authority on the subject, considers that the word was
created by one of the early Indo-Germanic races. He
identifies the root <i>ait</i> with the Greek <span title="aith">&alpha;&iota;&prime;&theta;</span> and the Latin
<i>aed</i>&mdash;to burn, as in <i>aes</i>-tu. The Greek name <span title="Aitna">&Alpha;&iota;&tau;&nu;&alpha;</span> was
known to Hesiod. The more modern name, <i>Mongibello</i>,
by which the mountain is still commonly known to the
Sicilians, is a combination of the Arabic <i>Gibel</i>, and the
Italian <i>Monte</i>. During the Saracenic occupation of Sicily,
Etna was called <i>Gibel Uttamat</i>&mdash;the mountain of fire;
and the last syllables of Mongibello are a relic of the
Saracenic name. A mountain near Palermo is still
called Gibel Rosso&mdash;the red mountain; and names may
not unfrequently be found in the immediate neighbourhood
of Etna which are partly, or sometimes even
entirely, composed of Arabic words; such, for example,
as <i>Alcantara</i>&mdash;the river of <i>the bridge</i>. Etna is also often
spoken of distinctively as <i>Il Monte</i>&mdash;the mountain <i>par
excellence</i>; a name which, in its capacity of the largest
mountain in the kingdom of Italy, and the loftiest
volcano in Europe, it fully justifies.</p>

<p>Etna is frequently alluded to by classical writers. By
the poets it was sometimes feigned to be the prison of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>the giant Enceladus or Typhon, sometimes the forge of
Hephaistos, and the abode of the Cyclops.</p>

<p>It is strange that Homer, who has so minutely described
certain portions of the contiguous Sicilian coast,
does not allude to Etna. This has been thought by
some to be a proof that the mountain was in a quiescent
state during the period which preceded and coincided
with the time of Homer.</p>

<p>Pindar (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 522-442) is the first writer of antiquity
who has described Etna. In the first of the Pythian
Odes for Hieron, of the town of Aitna, winner in the
chariot race in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 474, he exclaims:</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "He (Typhon) is fast bound by a pillar of the
sky, even by snowy Etna, nursing the whole year's
length her dazzling snow. Whereout pure springs of
unapproachable fire are vomited from the inmost depths:
in the daytime the lava-streams pour forth a lurid rush
of smoke; but in the darkness a red rolling flame
sweepeth rocks with uproar to the wide deep sea&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
That dragon-thing (Typhon) it is that maketh issue
from beneath the terrible fiery flood."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>&AElig;schylus (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 525-456) speaks also of the "mighty
Typhon," (<i>Prometheus</i> V.):</p>

<p class="poem">
. . . . . "He lies<br />
A helpless, powerless carcase, near the strait<br />
Of the great sea, fast pressed beneath the roots<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Of ancient Etna, where on highest peak<br />
Heph&aelig;stos sits and smites his iron red hot,<br />
From whence hereafter streams of fire shall burst,<br />
Devouring with fierce jaws the golden plains<br />
Of fruitful, fair Sikelia."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
</p>

<p>Herein he probably refers to the eruption which had
occurred a few years previously (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 476).</p>

<p>Thucydides (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 471-402) alludes in the last lines
of the Third Book to several early eruptions of the
mountain in the following terms: "In the first days of
this spring, the stream of fire issued from Etna, as on
former occasions, and destroyed some land of the
Catanians, who live upon Mount Etna, which is the
largest mountain in Sicily. Fifty years, it is said, had
elapsed since the last eruption, there having been three
in all since the Hellenes have inhabited Sicily."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Virgil's oft-quoted description of the mountain (<i>Eneid</i>,
Bk. 3) we give in the spirited translation of Conington:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"But Etna with her voice of fear<br /></span>
<span>In weltering chaos thunders near.<br /></span>
<span>Now pitchy clouds she belches forth<br /></span>
<span>Of cinders red, and vapour swarth;<br /></span>
<span>And from her caverns lifts on high<br /></span>
<span>Live balls of flame that lick the sky:<br /></span>
<span>Now with more dire convulsion flings<br /></span>
<span>Disploded rocks, her heart's rent strings,<br /></span>
<span>And lava torrents hurls to-day<br /></span>
<span>A burning gulf of fiery spray."</span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Many other early writers speak of the mountain, among
them Theokritos, Aristotle, Ovid, Livy, Seneca, Lucretius,
Pliny, Lucan, Petronius, Cornelius Severus, Dion
Cassius, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Lucilius Junior.
Seneca makes various allusions to Etna, and mentions
the fact that lightning sometimes proceeded from its
smoke.</p>

<p>Strabo has given a very fair description of the mountain.
He asserts that in his time the upper part of
it was bare, and covered with ashes, and in winter with
snow, while the lower slopes were clothed with forests.
The summit was a plain about twenty stadia in circumference,
surrounded by a ridge, within which there
was a small hillock, the smoke from which ascended to
a considerable height. He further mentions a second
crater. Etna was commonly ascended in Strabo's time
from the south-west.</p>

<p>While the poets on the one hand had invested the
mountain with various supernatural attributes, and had
made it the prison-house of a chained giant, and
the workshop of a swart god, Lucretius endeavoured
to show that the eruptions and other phenomena could
be easily explained by the ordinary operations of
nature. "And now at last," he writes, "I will explain
in what ways yon flame, roused to fury in a moment,
blazes forth from the huge furnaces of Aetna. And,
first, the nature of the whole mountain is hollow underneath,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
underpropped throughout with caverns of basalt
rocks. Furthermore, in all caves are wind and air, for
wind is produced when the air has been stirred and put
in motion. When this air has been thoroughly heated,
and, raging about, has imparted its heat to all the rocks
around, wherever it comes in contact with them, and to
the earth, and has struck out from them fire burning
with swift flames, it rises up and then forces itself out
on high, straight through the gorges; and so carries its
heat far, and scatters far its ashes, and rolls on smoke
of a thick pitchy blackness, and flings out at the same
time stones of prodigious weight&mdash;leaving no doubt that
this is the stormy force of air. Again, the sea, to a
great extent, breaks its waves and sucks back its surf
at the roots of that mountain. Caverns reach from this
sea as far as the deep gorges of the mountain below.
Through these you must admit [that air mixed up with
water passes; and] the nature of the case compels [this
air to enter in from that] open sea, and pass right
within, and then go out in blasts, and so lift up flame,
and throw out stones, and raise clouds of sand; for on
the summit are craters, as they name them in their
own language, what we call gorges and mouths."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>These ideas were developed by Lucilius Junior in a
poem consisting of 644 hexameters entitled <i>Aetna</i>. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>authorship of this poem has long been a disputed point;
it has been attributed to Virgil, Claudian, Quintilius
Varus, Manilius, and, by Joseph Scaliger<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and others,
to Cornelius Severus. Wensdorff was the first to adduce
reasons for attributing the poem to Lucilius Junior, and
his views are generally adopted. Lucilius Junior was
Procurator of Sicily under Nero, and, while resident in
the Island, he ascended Etna; and it is said that he
proposed writing a detailed history of the mountain.
He adopted the scientific opinions of Epicurus, as established
in Rome by Lucretius, and was more immediately
a disciple of Seneca. The latter dedicated to
him his <i>Qu&aelig;stiones Naturales</i>, in which he alludes more
than once to Etna. M. Chenu speaks of the poem of
Lucilius Junior as "sans doute tr&egrave;s-p&oacute;etique, mais
assez souvent dur, heurt&eacute;, concis, et parcela m&ecirc;me, d'une
obscurit&eacute; parfois d&eacute;sesp&eacute;rante."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> At the commencement
of the poem, Lucilius ridicules the ideas of the poets as
regards the connection of Etna with Vulcan and the
Cyclops. He has no belief in the practice, which
apparently prevailed in his time, of ascending to the
edge of the crater and there offering incense to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>tutelary gods of the mountain. He adopts to a great
extent the tone and style of Lucretius, in his explanation
of the phenomena of the mountain. Water filters through
the crevices and cracks in the rocks, until it comes into
contact with the internal fires, when it is converted into
vapour and expelled with violence. The internal fires
are nourished by the winds which penetrate into the
mountain. He traces some curious connection between
the plants which grow upon the mountain, and the
supply of sulphur and bitumen to the interior, which
is, at best, but partly intelligible.</p>

<p>Many of the myths developed by the earlier poets
had their home in the immediate neighbourhood, sometimes
upon the very sides, of Etna&mdash;Demeter seeking
Persephone; Acis and Galatea; Polyphemus and the
Cyclops. Mr. Symonds tells us that the one-eyed giant
Polyphemus was Etna itself, with its one great crater,
while the Cyclops were the many minor cones. "Persephone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
was the patroness of Sicily, because amid the
billowy corn-fields of her mother Demeter, and the
meadow-flowers she loved in girlhood, are ever found
sulphurous ravines, and chasms breathing vapour from
the pit of Hades."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>It is said that both Plato and the Emperor Hadrian
ascended Etna in order to witness the sunrise from its
summit. The story of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"He who to be deemed<br /></span>
<span>A god, leaped fondly into Etna flames,<br /></span>
<span>Empedokles"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is too trite to need repetition. A ruined tower near the
head of the Val del Bove, 9,570 feet above the sea, has
from time immemorial been called the <i>Torre del Filosofo</i>,
and is asserted to have been the observatory of Empedokles.
Others regard it as the remains of a Roman
tower, which was possibly erected on the occasion of
Hadrian's ascent of the mountain.</p>

<p>During the Middle Ages Etna is frequently alluded
to, among others by Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, and
Cardinal Bembo. The latter gives a description of the
mountain in the form of a dialogue, which Ferrara
characterises as "<i>erudito, e grecizzante, ma sensa nervi</i>."
He describes its general appearance, its well-wooded
sides, and sterile summit. When he visited the
mountain it had two craters about a stone's throw
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>apart; the larger of the two was said to be about three
miles in circumference, and it stood somewhat above
the other.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In 1541 Fazzello made an ascent of the mountain,
which he briefly describes in the fourth chapter of his
bulky volume <i>De Rebus Siculis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> This chapter is entitled
"<i>De Aetna monte et ejus ignibus</i>;" it contains a short
history of the mountain, and some mention of the principal
towns which he enumerates in the following
order: Catana, Tauromenium, Caltabianco, Linguagrossa,
Castroleone, Francavilla, Rocella, Randatio (Randazzo),
Bronte, Adrano, Paterno, and Motta. Fazzello speaks
of only one crater.</p>

<p>In 1591 Antonio Filoteo, who was born on Etna,
published a work in Venice in which he describes the
general features of the mountain, and gives a special
account of an eruption which he witnessed in 1536.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
The mountain was then, as now, divided into three
<i>Regions</i>. The first and uppermost of these, he asserts,
is very arid, rugged, and uneven, and full of broken
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>rocks; the second is covered with forests; and the third
is cultivated in the ordinary manner. Of the height he
remarks, "Ascensum triginta circiter millia passuum ad
plus habet." In regard to the name, <i>Mongibello</i>, he
makes a curious error, deriving it from <i>Mulciber</i>, one of
the names of Vulcan, who, as we have seen, was feigned
by the earlier poets to have had his forge within the
mountain.</p>

<p>In 1636 Carrera gave an account of Etna, followed by
that of the Jesuit Kircher, in 1638. The great eruption of
1669 was described at length by various eye-witnesses,
and furnished the subject of the first detailed description
of the eruptive phenomena of the mountain. Public
attention was now very generally drawn to the subject
in all civilised countries. It was described by the
naturalist, Borelli, and in our own <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>.
Lord Winchelsea, our ambassador at Constantinople,
was returning to England by way of the Straits
of Messina at the time of the eruption, and he forwarded
to Charles II "A true and exact relation of the late
prodigious earthquake and eruption of Mount &AElig;tna, or
Monte Gibello."</p>

<p>The first map of the mountain which we have been
able to meet with, was published in reference to the
eruption of 1669; it is entitled, "Plan du Mont Etna
communenent dit Mount Gibel en l'Isle de Scicille et
de t'incedie arrive par un treblement de terre le 8me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>Mars dernier 1669." This plan is in the Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale, in Paris; it was probably drawn from a
simple description, or perhaps altogether from the
imagination, as it is utterly unlike the mountain, the
sides of which possess an impossible steepness. Another
very inaccurate map was published in Nuremberg
about 1680, annexed to a map of Sicily, which is
entitled, "<i>Regnorum Sicili&aelig; et Sardini&aelig;, Nova Tabula</i>."
Again, in 1714 H. Moll, "geographer in Devereux
Street, Strand," published a new map of Italy, in which
there is a representation of Etna during the eruption of
1669. This also was probably drawn from the imagination;
no one who has ever seen the mountain would
recognise it, for it has a small base, and sides which
rival the Matterhorn in abruptness. Over against the
coast of Sicily, and near the mountain, is written:&mdash;"Mount
Etna, or Mount Gibello. This mountain sometimes
issues out pure flame, and at other times a thick
smoak with ashes; streams of fire run down with great
quantities of burning stones, and has made many eruptions."</p>

<p>During the eighteenth century Etna was frequently
ascended, and as frequently described. We have the
accounts of Massa (1703), Count D'Orville (1727),
Riedesel (1767), Sir William Hamilton (1769), Brydone
(1776), Houel (1786), Dolomieu (1788), Spallanzani
(1790), and many minor writers, such as Borch, Brocchi,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>Swinburne, Denon, and Faujas de Saint Fond. There
is great sameness in all of these narratives, and much
repetition of the same facts; some of them, however,
merit a passing notice.</p>

<p>Sir William Hamilton's <i>Campi Phlegr&aelig;i</i> relates mainly
to Vesuvius and the surrounding neighbourhood; but
one of the letters "addressed to the Secretary of the
Royal Society on October 17th, 1769," describes an
ascent of Etna. Hamilton ascended on June 24th with
the Canon Recupero and other companions; the few
observations of any value which he made have been
alluded to elsewhere under the head of the special
subjects to which they refer. The illustrations of the
<i>Campi Phlegr&aelig;i</i>, specially the original water-colours
which are contained in one of the British Museum
copies, are magnificent, and convey a better idea of
volcanic phenomena than any amount of simple
reading. From them we can well realise the opening
of a long rift extending down the sides of a mountain
during its eruption, and the formation of subsidiary
craters along the line of fire thus opened. Various
volcanic products are also admirably painted. In the
picture of Etna, however, which was drawn by Antonio
Fabris, the artist has scarcely been more successful
than his predecessors, and the slope of the sides of the
mountain has been greatly exaggerated.</p>

<p>M. Houel, in his <i>Voyage pittoresque dans les Deux</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span><i>Siciles</i>, 1781-1786, has given a fairly good account
of Etna, accompanied by some really excellent engravings.</p>

<p>In 1776 Patrick Brydone, a clever Irishman with a
good deal of native shrewdness and humour, published
two volumes of a <i>Tour in Sicily and Malta</i>, in which he
devoted several chapters to Mount Etna. He made the
ascent of the mountain, and collected from the Canon
Recupero, and from others, many facts concerning its
then present, and its past history. He also made observations
as to the height, temperature of the air at
various elevations, brightness of the stars, and so on.
Sir William Hamilton calls Brydone "a very ingenious and
accurate observer," and adds that he was well acquainted
with Alpine measurements. M. Elie de Beaumont,
writing in 1836, speaks of him as <i>le celebre Brydone</i>;
while, on the other hand, the Abb&eacute; Spallanzani, displeased
at certain remarks which he made concerning
Roman Catholicism in Sicily, never fails to deprecate his
work, and deplores "his trivial and insipid pleasantries."
Albeit Brydone's chapters on Etna furnished a more
complete account of the volcano than any which had
appeared in English up to that time; his remarks are
frequently very sound and just, and we shall have
occasion more than once to quote him.</p>

<p>It was reserved, however, for the Abate Francesco
Ferrara, Professor of Physical Science in the University
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>of Catania, to furnish the first history of Etna and of
its eruptions, which had any just claim to completeness.
It is entitled, <i>Descrizione dell' Etna, con la Storia delle
Eruzioni e il Catalogo del prodotti</i>. The first edition appeared
in 1793, and a second was printed in Palermo in
1818. The author had an enthusiastic love for his subject:&mdash;"Nato
sopra l'Etna," he writes, "che io conobbi
ben presto palmo a palmo la mia passione per lo studio
fiss&ograve; la mia attenzione sul bello, e terribile fenomeno che
avea avanti agli occhi." The work commences with a
general description of the mountain&mdash;its height, the
temperature of the different regions, the view from the
summit, the mass, the water-springs, the vegetable and
animal life, and the internal fires. This extends over
sixty-nine octavo pages. The second part of the book&mdash;eighty
pages&mdash;gives a history of the eruptions from the
earliest times to the year 1811; the third part&mdash;sixty-seven
pages&mdash;treats of the nature of the volcanic
products; and the fourth part&mdash;thirty-four pages&mdash;discusses
certain geological and physical considerations
concerning the mountain. At the end there are a few
badly drawn and engraved woodcuts, and a map which,
although the trend of the coast-line is quite wrong, is
otherwise fairly good. The engravings represent the
mountain as seen from Catania; the Isole dei Ciclopi,
and the neighbouring coast; the Montagna della Motta;
and a view from Catania of the eruption of 1787. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>work has evidently to a great extent been a labour of
love; it is full of personal observations, and also
embodies the results of many other observers. It has
furnished the foundation of much that has since been
written concerning Etna.</p>

<p>The Canon Recupero has been alluded to above; he
accompanied Hamilton, Brydone, and others to the
summit of the mountain, and he was employed by the
Government to report on the flood which, in 1755,
descended with extraordinary violence through the Val
del Bove. Beyond this, Recupero does not appear to
have published anything concerning Etna, although it
was well known that he had plenty of materials. He
died in 1778, and it was not till the year 1815 that his
results were published under the title of <i>Storia Naturale
et Generale dell' Etna, del Canonico Giuseppe Recupero.&mdash;Opera
Postuma</i>. This work consists of two bulky quarto
volumes, the first of which is devoted to a general description
of the mountain, the second to a history of the
eruptions, and an account of the products of eruptions.
Some idea may be formed of the extreme prolixity of
the author if we mention that two chapters, together
containing twelve quarto pages, are devoted to the
discussion of the height of Etna, while the first volume
is terminated by sixty-three closely printed pages of
annotations. A few rough woodcuts accompany the
volumes; a view of the mountain which, as usual, is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>out of all reason as regards abruptness of ascent, and a
<i>carta oryctographia di Mongibello</i> in which the trend
of the coast-line between Catania and Taormina is
altogether inexact, complete the illustrations of this most
detailed of histories.</p>

<p>During the years 1814-1816 Captain Smyth, acting
under orders from the Admiralty, made a survey of the
coast of Sicily, and of the adjacent islands. At this
time the Mediterranean charts were very defective;
some places on the coast of Sicily were mapped as much
as twenty miles out of their true position, and even the
exact positions of the observatories at Naples, Palermo,
and Malta were not known. Among other results,
Smyth carefully determined the latitude and longitude
of Etna, accurately measured its height, and examined
the surroundings of the mountain. His results were
published in 1824, and are often regarded as the most
accurate that we possess.</p>

<p>In 1824 Dr. Joseph Gemellaro, who lived all his
life on the mountain, and made it his constant study,
published an "Historical and Topographical Map of the
Eruptions of Etna from the era of the Sicani to the year
1824." In it he delineates the extent of the three
Regions, <i>Coltivata</i>, <i>Selvosa</i>, and <i>Deserta</i>; he places the
minor cones, to the number of seventy-four, in their proper
places, and he traces the course of the various lava-streams
which have flowed from them and from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>great crater. This map is the result of much patient
labour and study, and it is a great improvement upon
those of Ferrara and Recupero, but of course it is
impossible for one man to survey with much accuracy
an area of nearly 500 square miles, and to trace the
tortuous course of a large number of lava-streams.
Hence we must be prepared for inaccuracies, and they
are not uncommon&mdash;the coast line is altogether wrong
as to its bearings, some of the small towns on the sides
of the mountain are misplaced, and but little attention
has been paid to scale. Still the map is very useful,
as it is the only one which shows the course of the lava-streams.</p>

<p>Mario Gemellaro, brother of the preceding, made
almost daily observations of the condition of Etna,
between the years 1803 and 1832. These results were
tabulated, and they are given in the <i>Vulcanologia dell' Etna</i>
of his brother, Professor Carlo Gemellaro, under
the title of <i>Registro di Osservazioni del Sigr. Mario
Gemellaro</i>.</p>

<p>Carlo Gemellaro contributed many memoirs on subjects
connected with the mountain. They are chiefly to
be found in the <i>Atti dell' Accademia Gioenia</i> of Catania,
and they extend over a number of years. Perhaps the
most important is the treatise entitled "<i>La Vulcanologia
dell' Etna che comprende la Topographia, la Geologia, la
Storia, delle sue Eruzioni</i>." It was published in Catania
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>in 1858, and is dedicated to Sir Charles Lyell, who
ascended the mountain under the guidance of the author.
The latter also published a <i>Breve Raggualio della Eruzione
dell' Etna, del 21 Agosto 1852</i>, which contains the most
authentic account of this important eruption, accompanied
by some graphic sketches made on the spot.
The last contribution of Carlo Gemellaro to the history
of Etna, is fitly entitled <i>Un Addio al Maggior Vulcano di
Europa</i>. It was published in 1866, and with pardonable
vanity the author reviews his work in connection with
the mountain, extending over a period of more than
forty years. He commences his somewhat florid farewell
with the following apostrophe:&mdash;"O Etna! splendida
e perenne manifestazione della esistenza dei Fuochi
sotteranei massimo fra quanti altri monti, dalle coste
meridionali di Europa, dalle orientali dell' Asia e delle
settentrionali dell' Africa si specchiano nel Mediterraneo:
tremendo pei tuoi incendii: benigno per la fertilit&agrave; del
vulcanico tuo terreno ridotto a prospera coltivazione . . .
io, nato appi&egrave; del vasto tuo cono, in quella Citt&agrave; che
hai minacciato pi&ugrave; d'una volta di sepellire sotto le tue
infocate correnti: allogato, nella mia prima et&agrave;, in una
stanza della casa paterna, che signoreggiava in allora pi&ugrave;
basse abizioni vicine, ed intiera godeva la veduta della
estesa parte meridional&egrave; della tua mole, io non potera
non averti di continuo sotto gli occhi, e non essere
spettatore dei tuoi visibili fenomeni!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>In 1834, M. Elie de Beaumont commenced a minute
geological examination of the mountain. His results
were published in 1838, under the title of <i>Recherches sur
la structure et sur l'origine du Mont Etna</i>, and they
extend over 225 pages.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He re-determined the latitude
and longitude of the mountain, measured the slope of
the cone, and the diameter of the great crater, and
minutely examined the structure of the rocks at the
base of the mountain. He also gives a good sectional
view, elevations taken from each quarter of the compass,
and a geological map, which although accurate in its
general details, can scarcely be considered very satisfactory.
A relief map of Etna, a copy of which is in
the Royal School of Mines, was afterwards constructed
from the flat map, and this was, we believe, at the same
time, the first geological map, and the first map in relief,
which had been made of the mountain. Elie de Beaumont
considers granite as the basis of the mountain,
because it is sometimes ejected from the crater; old
basaltic rocks appear in the Isole dei Ciclopi, and near
Paterno, Licodia, and Aderno; <i>cailloux roul&eacute;s</i> near
Motta; ancient lavas on each side of the Val del Bove;
modern lavas in every part of the mountain, and
calcareous and arenaceous rocks in the surrounding
mountains.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>In 1836, Abich published some excellent sections
of Etna, and an accurate view of the interior of the
crater, in a work entitled <i>Vues illustratives de quelques
Ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes G&eacute;ologiques prises sur le V&eacute;suve et l'Etna
pendant les ann&eacute;es 1833 and 1834</i>.</p>

<p>The whole of the thirteenth volume (1839) of the
Berlin <i>Archiv f&uuml;r Mineralogie, Geognosie, Berghau und
H&uuml;ttenkunde</i>, is occupied by an elaborate memoir on the
geology of Sicily<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> by Friedrich Hoffmann, accompanied
by an excellent geological map. A long account of the
geology of Etna is given, and an enlarged map of the
mountain was afterwards constructed and published in
the <i>Vulkanen Atlas</i> of Dr. Leonhard in 1850.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In 1836 Baron Sartorius Von Waltershausen commenced
a minute survey of Etna, preparatory to a
complete description of the mountain, both geological
and otherwise. He was assisted by Professor Cavallari
of Palermo, Professor Peters of Hensbourg, and Professor
Roos of Mayence. The survey occupied six years,
(1836-1842), and the results of direct observation in
the form of maps and drawings, occupied a hundred
sheets 160 millimetres (6&frac14; inches) long, by 133 m.m.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>(5&frac14; inches) broad. Twenty-nine separate points were
made use of in the triangulation; and the scale chosen
was 1 in 50,000. The results were published in a large
folio atlas, which appeared in eight parts; the first in
1845 and the last in 1861, when the death of Von
Waltershausen put an end to the further publication.
There are 26 fine coloured maps, and 31 engravings.
The cost of the atlas is &pound;12. The maps are both geological
and topographical, and they are accompanied by
outline engravings of various details of special interest.
The <i>Atlas des Aetna</i> furnishes the most exhaustive history
of any one mountain on the face of the earth, and Sartorius
Von Waltershausen will always be the principal authority
on the subject of Etna.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Lyell visited Etna in 1824, 1857, and
again in 1858. He embodied his researches in a paper
presented to the Royal Society in 1859, and in a lengthy
chapter in the <i>Principles of Geology</i>. His investigations
have added much to our knowledge of the formation and
geological characteristics of the mountain, especially of
that part of it called the Val del Bove.</p>

<p>Later writers usually quote Von Waltershausen and
Lyell, and do not add much original matter. The facts
of all subsequent writers are taken more or less directly
from these authors. The latest addition to the literature
of the mountain, is the <i>Wanderungen am Aetna</i> of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>Dr. Baltzer, in the journal of the Swiss Alpine Club for
1874.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>A fine map of Sicily, on the unusually large scale of 1
in 50,000, or 1&middot;266 inch to a mile, was constructed by
the Stato Maggiore of the Italian government, between
1864 and 1868. The portion relating to Etna, and its
immediate surroundings occupies four sheets. All the
small roads and rivulets are introduced; the minor cones
and monticules are placed in their proper positions, and
the elevation of the ground is given at short intervals of
space over the entire map. An examination of this map
shows us that distances, areas, and heights, have been
repeatedly misstated, the minor cones misplaced, and the
trend of the coast line misrepresented. For example, if
we draw a line due north and south through Catania,
and a second line from the Capo di Taormina, (the north-eastern
limit of the base of Etna), until it meets the first
line at Catania, the lines, will be found to enclose an
angle of 26&deg;. If we adopt the same plan with Gemellaro's
map, the included angle is found to be 53&deg;, and
in the case of the maps of Ferrara and Recupero more
than 60&deg;. Again, it has been stated on good authority,
that the lava of 396 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> which enters the sea at Capo di
Schiso flowed for a distance of nearly 30 miles; the map
shows us that its true course was less than 16 miles.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>Lyell in 1858 gives a section of the mountain from
West 20&deg; N., to East 20&deg; S., but a comparison with the
new map proves that the section is really taken from
West 35&deg; N. to East 35&deg; S., an error which at a radius
of ten miles from the crater would amount to a difference
of nearly three miles.</p>

<p>The mantle of Carlo Gemellaro appears to have fallen
upon Cav. Orazio Silvestri, Professor of Chemistry in
the University of Catania. He has devoted himself with
unwearying vigour to the study of the mountain, and
his memoirs have done much to elucidate its past and
present history. His most recent work of importance on
the subject is entitled <i>I Fenomeni Vulcanici presentati
dall' Etna nel 1863-64-65-66</i>. It was published in
Catania in 1867, and contains an account of some
very elaborate chemico-geological researches.</p>

<p><br /><span class="smcap">In</span> the preceding chapter we have discussed the
history of Mount Etna; the references to its phenomena
afforded by writers of various periods; and the present
state of the literature of the subject. We have now to
consider the general aspect and physical features of the
mountain, together with the divisions of its surface into
distinct regions.</p>

<p>The height of Etna has been often determined. The
earlier writers had very extravagant notions on the
subject, and three miles has sometimes been assigned
to it. Brydone, Saussure, Shuckburgh, Irvine, and
others, obtained approximations to the real height;
it must be borne in mind, however, that the cone of a
volcano is liable to variations in height at different
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>periods, and a diminution of as much as 300 feet occurred
during one of the eruptions of Etna, owing to the falling
in of the upper portion of the crater. During the last
sixty years, however, the height of the mountain has been
practically constant. In 1815 Captain Smyth determined
it to be 10,874 feet. In 1824 Sir John Herschel,
who was unacquainted with Smyth's results, estimated
it at 10,872&frac12; feet. The new map of the Stato Maggiore
gives 3312&middot;61 metres = 10867&middot;94 feet.</p>

<p>When the Canon Recupero devoted two chapters of his
quarto volume to a discussion of the height of Etna, no
such exact observations had been made, consequently he
compared, and critically examined, the various determinations
which then existed. The almost perfect concordance
of the results given by Smyth, Herschel, and
the Stato Maggiore, render it unnecessary for us to
further discuss a subject about which there can now be
no difference of opinion.</p>

<p>Professor Jukes says, "If we were to put Snowdon,
the highest mountain in Wales, on the top of Ben Nevis,
the highest in Scotland, and Carrantuohill, the highest
in Ireland, on the summit of both, we should make a
mountain but a very little higher than Etna, and we
should require to heap up a great number of other
mountains round the flanks of our new one in order to
build a gentle sloping pile which should equal Etna in
bulk."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>The extent of radius of vision from the summit of Etna
is very variously stated. The exaggerated notions of the
earlier writers, that the coast of Africa and of Greece are
sometimes visible, may be at once set aside. Lord
Ormonde's statement that he saw the Gulf of Taranta,
and the mountains of Terra di Lecce beyond it&mdash;a distance
of 245 miles&mdash;must be received with caution. It is,
however, a fact that Malta, 130 miles distant, is often
visible; and Captain Smyth asserts that a considerable
portion of the upper part of the mountain may sometimes
be seen, and that he once saw more than half of it, from
Malta, although that island is usually surrounded by a
sea-horizon. It is stated on good authority that Monte
S. Giuliano above Trapani, and the &OElig;gadean Isles, 160
miles distant, are sometimes seen. Other writers give
128 miles as the limit. The fact is, that atmospheric
refraction varies so much with different conditions of the
atmosphere that it is almost impossible to give any exact
statement. The more so when we remember that there
may be many layers of atmosphere of different density
between the observer and the horizon. Distant objects
seem to be just under one's feet when seen from the summit
of the mountain. Smyth gives the radius of vision
as 150&middot;7 miles: and this we are inclined to adopt as the
nearest approach to the truth, because Smyth was an
accurate observer, and he made careful corrections both
for error of instruments and for refraction. This radius
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>gives an horizon of 946&middot;4 miles of circumference, and an
included area of 39,900 square miles&mdash;larger than the
area of Ireland. If a circle be traced with the crater
of Etna as a centre, and a radius of 150&middot;7 miles, it
will be found to take in the whole of Sicily and Malta,
to cut the western coast of Italy at Scalca in Calabria,
leaving the south-east coast near Cape Rizzuto. Such
a circle will include the whole of Ireland, or if we take
Derby as the centre, its circumference will touch the sea
beyond Yarmouth on the East, the Isle of Wight on the
South, the Irish Channel on the West, and it will pass
beyond Carlisle and Newcastle-on-Tyne on the North.</p>

<p>The road which surrounds the mountain is carried
along its lower slopes, and is 87 miles in length. It
passes through the towns of Paterno, Aderno, Bronte,
Randazzo, Linguaglossa, Giarre, and Aci Reale. It is
considered by some writers to define the base of the
mountain, which is hence most erroneously said to have
a circumference of 87 miles; but the road frequently
passes over high beds of lava, and winds considerably.
It is about 10 miles from the crater on the North, East,
and West sides, increasing to 15&frac12; miles at Paterno,
(S.W.). The elevation on the North and West flanks of
the mountain is nearly 2,500 feet, while on the South
it falls to 1,500 feet, and on the East to within 50 feet
of the level of the sea. It is quite clear that it cannot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>be asserted with any degree of accuracy to define the
base of the mountain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 693px;">
<a name="Sections_of_Etna" id="Sections_of_Etna"></a><img src="images/fp030.jpg" width="693" height="249" alt="" title="Section of Mount Etna in a direction nearly East and West. (Von Abich)  Section in a direction N.N.W. and S.S.E." />
<p class='caption'>Sections of Etna</p>
</div>

<p>The "natural boundaries" of Etna are the rivers
Alcantara and Simeto on the North, West, and South,
and the sea on the East to the extent of 23 miles of
coast, along which lava streams have been traced, sometimes
forming headlands several hundred feet in height.
The base of the mountain, as defined by these natural
boundaries, is said to have a circumference of "at least
120 miles," an examination of the new map, however,
proves that this is over-estimated.</p>

<p>If we take the sea as the eastern boundary, the river
Alcantara, (immediately beyond which Monte di Mojo,
the most northerly minor cone of Etna is situated), as
the northern boundary, and the river Simeto as the
boundary on the west and south, we obtain a circumference
of 91 miles for the base of Etna. In this estimate
the small sinuosities of the river have been neglected, and
the southern circuit has been completed by drawing a
line from near Paterno to Catania, because the Simeto
runs for the last few miles of its course through the plain
of Catania, quite beyond the most southerly stream of
lava. The Simeto (anciently <i>Sim&aelig;thus</i>) is called the
Giaretta along the last three miles of its course, after its
junction with the Gurna Longa.</p>

<p>The area of the region enclosed by these boundaries is
approximately 480 square miles. Reclus gives the area
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>of the mountain as 1,200 square kilometres&mdash;461 square
miles. (<i>Nouvelle Geographie Universelle</i>, 1875.) The
last edition of a standard Gazetteer states it as "849
square miles;" but this estimate is altogether absurd.
This would require a circle having a radius of between
sixteen and seventeen miles. If a circle be drawn
with a radius of sixteen miles from the crater, it
will pass out to sea to a distance of 4&frac12; miles on the
East, while on the West and North it will pass through
limestone and sandstone formations far beyond the Alcantara
and the Simeto, and beyond the limit of the lava
streams.</p>

<p>There are two cities, Catania and Aci Reale, and sixty-two
towns or villages on Mount Etna. It is far more
thickly populated than any other part of Sicily or Italy,
for while the population of the former is 228 per square
mile, and of the latter 233, the population of the habitable
zone of Etna amounts to 1,424 per square mile. More
than 300,000 persons live on the slopes of the mountain.
Thus with an area rather larger than that of Bedfordshire
(462 square miles) the mountain has more than double
the population; and with an area equal to about one-third
that of Wiltshire, the population of the mountain
is greater by nearly 50,000 inhabitants. We have stated
above that the area of Etna is 480 square miles, but it
must be borne in mind that the habitable zone only
commences at a distance of about 9&frac14; miles from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>crater. A circle, having a radius of 9&frac14; miles, encloses
an area of 269 square miles; and 480 minus 269 leaves
211 square miles as the approximate area of the habitable
zone. Only a few insignificant villages on the East
side are nearer to the crater than 9&frac14; miles. Taking
the inhabitants as 300,000, we find, by dividing this
number by 211, (the area of the habitable zone), that
the population amounts to 1,424 per square mile. Even
Lancashire, the most populous county in Great Britain,
(of course excepting Middlesex), and the possessor of
two cities, which alone furnish more than a million inhabitants,
has a population of only 1,479 to the square
mile.</p>

<p>Some idea of the closeness of the towns and villages
may be found by examining the south-east corner of the
map. If we draw a line from Aci Reale to Nicolosi, and
from Nicolosi to Catania, we enclose a nearly equilateral
triangle, having the coast line between Aci Reale and
Catania as its third side.</p>

<p>Starting from Aci Reale with 24,151 inhabitants, and
moving westwards to Nicolosi, we come in succession to
Aci S. Lucia, Aci Catena, Aci S. Antonio, Via Grande,
Tre Castagni, Pedara, Nicolosi, completing the first side
of the triangle; then turning to the south-east and
following the Catania road, we pass Torre di Grifo,
Mascalucia, Gravina, and reach Catania with 85,055 inhabitants;
while on the line of coast between Catania
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>and Aci Reale we have Ognina, Aci Castello, and Trezza.
Within the triangle we find Aci Patane, Aci S. Filippo,
Valverde, Bonacorsi, S. Gregorio, Tremestieri, Piano,
S. Agata, Trappeto, and S. Giovanni la Punta: in all
twenty-five, two of which are cities, several of the others
towns of about 3,000 inhabitants, and the rest villages.
These are all included within an area of less than thirty
square miles, which constitutes the most populous portion
of the habitable zone of Etna.</p>

<p>That the population is rapidly increasing is well shown
by a comparison of the number of inhabitants of some of
the more important towns in 1824 and in 1876.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>The general aspect of Etna is that of a pretty regular
cone, covered with vegetation, except near the summit.
The regularity is broken on the East side by a slightly
oval valley, four or five miles in diameter, called the
<i>Val del Bove</i>, or in the language of the district Val
del <i>Bue</i>. This commences about two miles from the
summit, and is bounded on three sides by nearly vertical
precipices from 3,000 to 4,000 feet in height. The
bottom of the valley is covered with lavas of various date,
and several minor craters have from time to time been
upraised from it. Many eruptions have commenced in
the immediate neighbourhood of the Val del Bove, and
Lyell believes that there formerly existed a centre of
permanent eruption in the valley. The Val del Bove
is altogether sterile; but the mountain at the same
level is, on other sides, clothed with trees. The vast
mass of the mountain is realised by the fact that, after
twelve miles of the ascent from Catania, the summit
looks as far off as it did at starting. Moreover, Mount
Vesuvius might be almost hidden away in the Val del
Bove.</p>

<p>A remarkable feature of Etna is the large number of
minor craters which are scattered over its sides. They
look small in comparison with the great mass of the
mountain, but in reality some of them are of large
dimensions. Monte Minardo, near Bronte, the largest
of these minor cones, is still 750 feet high, although
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>its base has been raised by modern lava-streams which
have flowed around it. There are 80 of the more
conspicuous of these minor cones, but Von Waltershausen
has mapped no less than 200 within a ten mile
radius from the great crater, while neglecting many
monticules of ashes. As to the statement made by
Reclus to the effect that there are 700 minor cones,
and by Jukes, that the number is 600, it is to be
supposed that they include not only the most insignificant
monticules and heaps of cinders, but also the
<i>bocche</i> and <i>boccarelle</i> from which at any time lava or
fire has issued. If these be included, no doubt these
numbers are not exaggerations.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 485px;">
<a name="Grotto_delle_Palombe" id="Grotto_delle_Palombe"></a><img src="images/fp036.jpg" width="485" height="329" alt="" title="" />
<p class='caption'>Grotto delle Palombe near Nicolosi</p>
</div>

<p>The only important minor cone which has been produced
during the historical period, is the double mountain
known as Monti Rossi, from the red colour of the cinders
which compose it. This was raised from the plain of
Nicolosi during the eruption of 1669; it is 450 feet in
height, and two miles in circumference at the base. In a
line between the Monti Rossi and the great crater, thirty-three
minor cones may be counted. Hamilton counted
forty-four, looking down from the summit towards Catania,
and Captain Smyth was able to discern fifty at once from
an elevated position on the mountain. Many of these
parasitic cones are covered with vegetation, as the names
Monte Faggi, Monte Ilice, Monte Zappini, indicate. The
names have not been happily chosen; thus there are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>several cones in different parts of the mountain called
by the same name&mdash;Monte Arso, Monte Nero, Monte
Rosso, Monte Frumento, are the most common of the
duplicates. Moreover, the names have from time to time
been altered, and it thus sometimes becomes difficult
to trace a cone which has been alluded to under a
former name, or by an author who wrote before the
name was changed. In addition to the minor cones
from which lava once proceeded, there are numerous
smaller vents for the subterranean fires called <i>Bocche</i>,
or if very small, <i>Boccarelle</i>, <i>del Fuoco</i>. In the eruption of
1669, thirteen mouths opened in the course of a few
days; and in the eruption of 1809, twenty new mouths
opened one after the other in a line about six miles
long. Two new craters were formed in the Val del
Bove in 1852, and seven craters in 1865. The outbursts
of lava from lateral cones are no doubt due to the fact
that the pressure of lava in the great crater, which is
nearly 1000 feet in depth, becomes so great that the
lava is forced out at some lower point of less resistance.
The most northerly of the minor cones is Monte di
Mojo, from whence issued the lava of 396 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, it is
11&frac12; miles from the crater; the most southerly cone is
Monte Ste Sofia, 16 miles from the crater. Nearly all
the minor cones are within 10 miles of the crater, and
the majority are collected between south-east, and
west, that is, in an angular space of 135&deg;, starting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>midway between east and south, (45&deg; south of due
east) to due west, (90&deg; west of due south). Lyell
speaks of the minor cones "as the most grand and
original feature in the physiognomy of Etna."</p>

<p>A number of caverns are met with in various parts
of Etna; Boccacio speaks of the Cavern of Thalia, and
several early writers allude to the Grotto delle Palombe
near Nicolosi. The latter is situated in front of Monte
Fusara, and the entrance to it is evidently the crater
of an extinct monticule. It descends for 78 feet, and
at the bottom a cavern is entered by a long shaft;
this leads to a second cavern, which abruptly descends,
and appears to be continued into the heart of the
neighbouring Monti Rossi. Brydone says that people
have lost their senses in these caverns, "imagining
that they saw devils, and the spirits of the damned;
for it is still very generally believed that Etna is the
mouth of Hell." Many of the caverns near the upper
part of the mountain are used for storing snow, and
sometimes as places of shelter for shepherds. We have
already seen to what extent Lucretius attributed the
eruptions to air pent up within the interior caverns of
the mountains.</p>

<p>The surface of the mountain has been divided into
three zones or regions&mdash;the <i>Piedimontana</i> or <i>Coltivata</i>;
the <i>Selvosa</i> or <i>Nemorosa</i>; and the <i>Deserta</i> or <i>Discoperta</i>.
Sometimes the name of <i>Regione del Fuoco</i> is given to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>the central cone and crater. As regards temperature,
the zones correspond more or less to the Torrid,
Temperate, and Frigid. The lowest of these, the <i>Cultivated
Region</i>, yields in abundance all the ordinary
Sicilian products. The soil, which consists of decomposed
lava, is extremely fertile, although of course large
tracts of land are covered by recent lavas, or by those
which decompose slowly. In this region the vine
flourishes, and abundance of corn, olives, pistachio nuts,
oranges, lemons, figs, and other fruit trees.</p>

<p>The breadth of this region varies; it terminates at
an approximate height of 2000 feet. A circle drawn
with a radius of 10 miles from the crater, roughly
defines the limit. The elevation of this on the north
is 2,310 feet near Randazzo; on the south, 2,145
feet near Nicolosi; on the east, 600 feet near Mascali;
and on the west, 1,145 feet near Bronte. The breadth
of this cultivated zone is about 2 miles on the north,
east, and west, and 9 or 10 on the south, if we
take for the base of the mountain the limits proposed
above.</p>

<p>The <i>Woody Region</i> commences where the cultivated
region ends, and extends as a belt of varying width to
an approximate height of 6,300 feet. It is terminated
above by a circle having a radius of nearly 1&frac12; miles
from the crater. There are fourteen separate forests
in this region: some abounding with the oak, beech,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>pine, and poplar, others with the chestnut, ilex, and
cork tree.</p>

<p>The celebrated <i>Castagno di Cento Cavalli</i>, one of the
largest and oldest trees in the world, is in the Forest
of Carpinetto, on the East side of the mountain, five
miles above Giarre. This tree has the appearance of
five separate trunks united into one, but Ferrara declares
that by digging a very short distance below the surface
he found one single stem. The public road now passes
through the much-decayed trunk. Captain Smyth
measured the circumference a few feet from the ground,
and found it to be 163 feet, which would give it a
diameter of more than 50 feet. The tree derives its
name from the story that one of the Queens of Arragon
took shelter in its trunk with a suite of 100 horsemen.
Near this patriarch are several large chestnuts, which,
without a shadow of doubt, are single trees; one of these
is 18 feet in diameter, and a second 15 feet, while the
<i>Castagno della Galea</i>, higher up on the mountain, is 25
feet in diameter, and probably more than 1000 years old.
The breadth of the Regione Selvosa varies considerably,
as may be seen by reference to the accompanying map; in
the direction of the Val del Bove it is very narrow, while
elsewhere it frequently has a breadth of from 6 to 8 miles.</p>

<p>The Desert Region is embraced between the limit of
6,300 feet and the summit. It occupies about 10 square
miles, and consists of a dreary waste of black sand,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>scori&aelig;, ashes, and masses of ejected lava. In winter
it remains permanently covered with snow, and even in
the height of summer snow may be found in certain
rifts.</p>

<p>Botanists have divided the surface of Etna into seven
regions. The first extends from the level of the sea
to 100 feet above it, and in it flourishes the palm,
banana, Indian fig or prickly pear, sugar-cane, mimosa,
and acacia. It must be remembered, however, that it is
only on the east side of the mountain that the level within
the base sinks to 100 feet above the sea; and, moreover,
that the palm, banana, and sugar-cane, are comparative
rarities in this part of Sicily. Prickly pears and vines
are the most abundant products of the lower slopes of
the eastern side of Etna. The second, or hilly region,
reaches from 100 to 2000 feet above the sea, and
therefore constitutes, with the preceding, the <i>Regione
Coltivata</i> of our former division. In it are found cotton,
maize, orange, lemon, shaddock, and the ordinary
Sicilian produce. The culture of the vine ceases near
its upward limit. The third, or woody region, reaches
from 2000 to 4000 feet, and the principal trees within
it are the cork, oak, maple, and chestnut. The fourth
region extends from 4000 to 6000 feet, and contains
the beech, Scotch fir, birch, dock, plaintain, and sandworth.
The fifth, or sub-Alpine region, extending from
6000 to 7000 feet, contains the barberry, soapwort,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>toad-flax, and juniper. In the sixth region, 7,500 to
9000 feet, are found soapwort, sorrel, and groundsel;
while the last narrow zone, 9000 to 9,200 feet, contains
a few lichens, the commonest of which is the <i>Stereocaulon
Paschale</i>. The flora of Etna comprises 477 species,
only 40 of which are found between 7000 feet and the
summit, while in the last 2000 feet only five phanerogamous
species are found, viz., Anthemis Etnensis,
Senecio Etnensis, Robertsia taraxacoides, (which are
peculiar to Etna), Tanacetum vulgare, and Astragulus
Siculus. Common ferns, such as the <i>pteris aquilina</i>, are
found in abundance beneath the trees in the Regione
Selvosa.</p>

<p>This division has been advocated by Presl in his <i>Flora
Sicula</i>.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> He names the different regions beginning from
below: <i>Regio Subtropica</i>, <i>Regio Collina</i>, <i>Regio Sylvatica
inferior</i>, <i>Regio fagi Sylvestris</i>. These four are
common to all Sicily. The three remaining regions,
<i>Regio Subalpina</i>, <i>Regio Alpina</i>, and <i>Regio Lichenum</i>,
together extending from 6000 to 9,200 feet, belong
to Etna alone.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the first volume of Recupero's
<i>Storia Naturale et Generale dell' Etna</i> we find a somewhat
different botanical division proposed by Signor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Rafinesque-Schmaltz.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> He makes his divisions in the
following manner:&mdash;</p>

<ol><li>Florula Piedemontana.</li>

<li>Florula Nemorosa.</li>

<li>Florula excelsa o della Regione Discoperta.</li>

<li>Florula Arenosa o della Regione delle Scorie.</li></ol>

<p>In the latter region, (to which he assigns no limit as to
height), he found Potentilla Argentea, Rumex Scutatus,
Tanacetum Vulgare, Anthemis Montana, Jacob&aelig;a Chrysanthemifolia,
Seriola Uniflora, and Phalaris Alpina.</p>

<p>As regards the animal life on Etna, of course it is the
same as that of the eastern sea-board of Sicily, except in
the higher regions, where it becomes more sparse. The
only living creatures in the upper regions are ants, a
little lower down Spallanzani found a few partridges,
jays, thrushes, ravens, and kites.</p>

<p>Brydone says of the three regions: "Besides the
corn, the wine, the oil, the silk, the spice, and delicious
fruits of its lower region; the beautiful forests, the flocks,
the game, the tar, the cork, the honey of its second; the
snow and ice of its third; it affords from its caverns a
variety of minerals and other productions&mdash;cinnabar,
mercury, sulphur, alum, nitre, and vitriol; so that this
wonderful mountain at the same time produces every
necessary, and every luxury of life."</p>

<p><br /><span class="smcap">The</span> ascent of Mount Etna has been described many times
during the last eighteen centuries, from Strabo in the
second century to Dr. Baltzer in 1875. One of the most
interesting accounts is certainly that of Brydone, and in
this century perhaps that of Mr. Gladstone. Of course
the interest of the expedition is greatly increased if it can
be combined with that spice of danger which is afforded
by the fact of the mountain being in a state of eruption
at the time.</p>

<p>The best period for making the ascent is between May
and September, after the melting of the winter snows,
and before the autumnal rains. In winter snow frequently
extends from the summit downwards for nine or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>ten miles; the paths are obliterated, and the guides refuse
to accompany travellers. Even so late in the spring as
May 29th Brydone had to traverse seven miles of snow
before reaching the summit. Moreover, violent storms
often rage in the upper regions of the mountain, and the
wind acquires a force which it is difficult to withstand,
and is at the same time piercingly cold. Sir William
Hamilton, in relating his ascent on the night of June
26th, 1769, remarks that, if they had not kindled a fire
at the halting place, and put on much warm clothing,
they would "surely have perished with the cold." At
the same time the wind was so violent that they had
several times to throw themselves on their faces to
avoid being overthrown. Yet the guides said that the
wind was not unusually violent. Some writers, well used
to Alpine climbing, have asserted that the cold on Etna
was more severe than anything they have ever experienced
in the Alps.</p>

<p>The writer of this memoir made the ascent of the
mountain in August 1877, accompanied by a courier and
a guide. We took with us two mules; some thick rugs;
provisions consisting of bread, meat, wine, coffee, and
brandy; wooden staves for making the ascent of the
cone; a geological hammer; a bag for specimens; and a
few other requisites. It has to be remembered that
absolutely nothing is to be met with at the Casa Inglesi,
where the halt is made for the night; even firewood has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>to be taken, a fire being most necessary in those elevated
regions even during a midsummer's night. For some
time previous to our ascent the weather had been
uniformly bright and fine, and there had been no rain
for more than three months. The mean temperature
in the shade at Catania, and generally along the eastern
sea-base of the mountain, was 82&deg; F.</p>

<p>As we desired to see the sunrise from the summit of
the mountain, we determined to ascend during the cool
of the evening, resting for an hour or two before sunrise
at the Casa Inglesi at the foot of the cone. Accordingly
we left Catania soon after midday, and drove to Nicolosi,
twelve miles distant, and 2,288 feet above the sea. The
road for some distance passed through a very fertile
district; on either side there were corn fields and vineyards,
and gardens of orange and lemon trees, figs and
almonds, growing luxuriantly in the decomposed lava.
About half way between Catania and Nicolosi stands the
village of Gravina, and a mile beyond it Mascalucia, a
small town containing nearly 4000 inhabitants. Near
this is the ruined church of St. Antonio, founded in
1300. Nine miles from Catania the village of Torre di
Grifo is passed, and the road then enters a nearly barren
district covered with the lava and scori&aelig; of 1527. The
only prominent form of vegetation is a peculiar tall
broom&mdash;<i>Genista Etnensis</i>&mdash;which here flourishes. We
are now entering the region of minor cones; the vineclad
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>cone of Monpilieri is visible on the left, and just
above it Monti Rossi, 3,110 feet above the sea; to the
right of the latter we see Monte San Nicola, Serrapizzuta,
and Monte Arso. We reach Nicolosi at half-past four;
for although the distance is short, the road is very rugged
and steep.</p>

<p>Nicolosi has a population of less than 3,000; it consists
of a long street, bordered by one-storied cottages
of lava. In the church the priests were preparing for a
<i>festa</i> in honour of S. Anthony of Padua. They politely
took us into the sacristy, and exhibited with much pride
some graven images of rather coarse workmanship,
which were covered with gilding and bright coloured
paint. Near Nicolosi stands the convent of S. Nicola
dell' Arena, once inhabited by Benedictine monks, who
however were compelled to abandon it in consequence of
the destruction produced by successive shocks of earthquake.
Nicolosi itself has been more than once shaken
to the ground. We dined pretty comfortably, thanks to
the courier who acted as cook, in the one public room of
the one primitive inn of the town; starting for the Casa
Inglesi at 6 o'clock. The good people of the inn surrounded
us at our departure and with much warmth
wished us a safe and successful journey.</p>

<p>For a short distance above Nicolosi, stunted vines are
seen growing in black cinders, but these soon give place
to a large tract covered with lava and ashes, with here
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>and there patches of broom. There was no visible path,
but the mules seemed to know the way perfectly, and
they continued to ascend with the same easy even pace
without any guidance, even after the sun had disappeared
behind the western flank of the mountain. In fact, you
trust yourself absolutely to your mule, which picks his
way over the roughest ground, and rarely stumbles or
changes his even step. I found it quite easy to write
notes while ascending, and even to use a pocket spectroscope
at the time of the setting sun. Subsequently we
saw a man extended at full length, and fast asleep upon
a mule, which was leisurely plodding along the highway.
The same confidence must not however be extended to the
donkeys of Etna, as I found to my cost a few days later at
Taormina.  Here the only animal to be procured to
carry me down to the sea-shore, 800 feet below, was a
donkey. It was during the hottest part of the day, and
it was necessary to carry an umbrella in one hand, and
comfortable to wear a kind of turban of many folds of
thin muslin round one's cap. The donkey after carefully
selecting the roughest and most precipitous part of the
road, promptly fell down, leaving me extended at full
length on the road, with the open umbrella a few yards
off. At the same time the turban came unfolded, and
stretched itself for many a foot upon the ground. Altogether
it was a most comical sight, and it reminded me
forcibly, and at the instant, of a picture which I once
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>saw over the altar of a church in Pisa, and which represented
S. Thomas Aquinas discomfiting Plato, Aristotle,
and Averr&ouml;es. The latter was completely overthrown,
and in the most literal sense, for he was grovelling in
the dust at the feet of S. Thomas, while his disarranged
turban had fallen from him.</p>

<p>The district of lava and ashes above Nicolosi is succeeded
by forests of small trees, and we are now fairly
within the <i>Regione Selvosa</i>. At half-past 8 o'clock the
temperature was 66&deg;, at Nicolosi at 4 o'clock it was 80&deg;.
About 9 o'clock we arrived at the Casa del Bosco, (4,216
feet), a small house in which several men in charge of the
forest live. Here we rested till 10 o'clock, and then after
I had put on a great-coat and a second waistcoat, we
started for the higher regions. At this time the air was
extraordinarily still, the flame of a candle placed near the
open door of the house did not flicker. The ascent from
this point carried us through forests of pollard oaks, in
which it was quite impossible to see either a path or any
obstacles which might lie in one's way. The guide
carried a lantern, and the mules seemed well accustomed
to the route. At about 6,300 feet we entered the
<i>Regione Deserta</i>, a lifeless waste of black sand, ashes,
and lava; the ascent became more steep, and the air
was bitterly cold. There was no moon, but the stars
shone with an extraordinary brilliancy, and sparkled like
particles of white-hot steel. I had never before seen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>the heavens studded with such myriads of stars. The
milky-way shone like a path of fire, and meteors flashed
across the sky in such numbers that I soon gave up
any attempt to count them. The vault of heaven
seemed to be much nearer than when seen from
the earth, and more flat, as if only a short distance
above our heads, and some of the brighter stars
appeared to be hanging down from the sky. Brydone, in
speaking of his impressions under similar circumstances
says:</p>

<p>"The sky was clear, and the immense vault of heaven
appeared in awful majesty and splendour. We found
ourselves more struck with veneration than below, and
at first were at a loss to know the cause, till we observed
with astonishment that the number of the stars seemed to
be infinitely increased, and the light of each of them appeared
brighter than usual. The whiteness of the milky-way
was like a pure flame that shot across the heavens,
and with the naked eye we could observe clusters of stars
that were invisible in the regions below. We did not at
first attend to the cause, nor recollect that we had now
passed through ten or twelve thousand feet of gross
vapour, that blunts and confuses every ray before it
reaches the surface of the earth. We were amazed at
the distinctness of vision, and exclaimed together, 'What
a glorious situation for an observatory! had Empedocles
had the eyes of Galileo, what discoveries must he not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>have made!' We regretted that Jupiter was not
visible, as I am persuaded we might have discovered
some of his satellites with the naked eye, or at least
with a small glass which I had in my pocket."</p>

<p>Brydone wrote a hundred years ago, but his idea
of erecting an observatory on Mount Etna was only
revived last year, when Prof. Tacchini the Astronomer
Royal at Palermo, communicated a paper to the
Accademia Gioenia, entitled "<i>Della Convenienza ed
utilita di erigere sull' Etna una Stazione Astronomico-Meteorologico</i>."
Tacchini mentions the extraordinary
blueness of the sky as seen from Etna, and the appearance
of the sun, which is "whiter and more tranquil"
than when seen from below. Moreover, the spectroscopic
lines are defined with wonderful distinctness. In the
evening at 10 o'clock, Sirius appeared to rival Venus,
the peculiarities of the ring of Saturn were seen far
better than at Palermo; and Venus emitted a light
sufficiently powerful to cast shadows; it also scintillated.
When the chromosphere of the sun was examined the
next morning by the spectroscope, the inversion of the
magnesium line, and of the line 1474 was immediately
apparent, although it was impossible to obtain this effect
at Palermo. Tacchini proposes that an observatory
should be established at the Casa Inglesi, in connection
with the University of Catania, and that it be provided
with a good six-inch refracting telescope, and with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>meteorological instruments. In this observatory, constant
observations should be made from the beginning of
June to the end of September, and the telescope should
then be transported to Catania, where a duplicate
mounting might be provided for it, and observations
continued for the rest of the year. There seems to be
every probability that this scheme will be carried out in
the course of next year.</p>

<p>During this digression we have been toiling along the
slopes of the <i>Regione Deserta</i> and looking at the sky; at
length we reach the <i>Piano del Lago</i> or Plain of the Lake,
so called because a lake produced by the melting of the
snows existed here till 1607, when it was filled up by lava.
The air is now excessively cold, and a sharp wind is
blowing. Progress is very slow, the soil consists of loose
ashes, and the mules frequently stop; the guide assures
us that the Casa Inglesi is quite near, but the stoppages
become so frequent that it seems a long way off; at
length we dismount, and drag the mules after us, and
after a toilsome walk the small lava-built house, called
the Casa Inglesi, is reached (1.30 a.m., temperature
40&deg; F.) It stands at a height of 9,652 feet above the
sea, near the base of the cone of the great crater, and
it takes its name from the fact that it was erected by
the English officers stationed in Sicily in 1811. It has
suffered severely from time to time from the pressure
of snow and from earthquakes, but it was thoroughly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>repaired in 1862, on the occasion of the visit of Prince
Humbert, and is now in tolerable preservation. It
consists of three rooms, containing a few deal chairs,
a table, and several shelves like the berths of ships
furnished with plain straw mattresses; there is also
a rough fireplace. We had no sooner reached this
house, very weary and so cold that we could scarcely
move, than it was discovered that the courier had
omitted to get the key from Nicolosi, and there seemed
a prospect of spending the hours till dawn in the open
air. Fortunately we had with us a chisel and a
geological hammer, and by the aid of these we forced
open the shutter serving as a window, and crept into
the house; ten minutes later a large wood fire was
blazing up the chimney, our eatables were unpacked,
some hot coffee was made, and we were supremely
comfortable.</p>

<p class='caption'>The Casa Inglesi and Cone of Etna</p>
</div>

<p>At 3 a.m. we left the Casa Inglesi for the summit
of the great crater, 1,200 feet above us, in order to be
in time to witness the sunrise. Our road lay for a
short distance over the upper portion of the Piano del
Lago, and the walking was difficult. The brighter stars
had disappeared, and it was much darker than it had
been some hours before. The guide led the way with
a lantern. The ascent of the cone was a very stiff
piece of work; it consists of loose ashes and blocks of
lava, and slopes at an angle of "45&deg; or more" according
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>to one writer, and of 33&deg; according to another; probably
the slope varies on different sides of the cone: we do not
think that the slope much exceeds 33&deg; anywhere on the
side of the cone which we ascended. Fortunately there
was no strong wind, and we did not suffer from the
sickness of which travellers constantly complain in the
rarefied air of the summit. We reached the highest
point at 4.30 a.m., and found a temperature of 47&deg; F.</p>

<p>When Sir William Hamilton ascended towards the
end of June the temperature at the base of the mountain
was 84&deg; F., and at the summit 56&deg; F. When Brydone
left Catania on May 26th, 1770, the temperature was
76&deg; F., Bar. 29 in. 8&frac12; lines; at Nicolosi at midday on
the 27th it was 73&deg; F., Bar. 27 in. 1&frac12; lines; at the
Spelonca del Capriole (6,200 feet), 61&deg; F., Bar. 26 in.
5&frac12; lines; at the foot of the crater, temp. 33&deg; F., Bar.
20 in. 4&frac12; lines, and at the summit of the crater just
before sunrise, temp. 27&deg; F., Bar. 19 in. 4 lines.</p>

<p>On reaching the summit we noticed that a quantity
of steam and sulphurous acid gas issued from the ground
under our feet, and in some places the cinders were so
hot that it was necessary to choose a cool place to sit
down upon. A thermometer inserted just beneath the
soil from which steam issued registered 182&deg; F. For a
short time we anxiously awaited the rising of the sun.
Nearly all the stars had faded away; the vault of
heaven was a pale blue, becoming a darker and darker
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>grey towards the west, where it appeared to be nearly
black. Just before sunrise the sky had the appearance
of an enormous arched spectrum, extremely extended at
the blue end. Above the place where the sun would
presently appear there was a brilliant red, shading off
in the direction of the zenith to orange and yellow; this
was succeeded by pale green, then a long stretch of pale
blue, darker blue, dark grey, ending opposite the
rising sun with black. This effect was quite distinct, it
lasted some minutes, and was very remarkable. This
was succeeded by the usual rayed appearance of the
rising sun, and at ten minutes to 5 o'clock the upper
limb of the sun was seen above the mountains of Calabria.
Examined by the spectroscope the Fraunhofer lines
were extremely distinct, particularly two lines near the
red end of the spectrum.</p>

<p>The top of the mountain was now illuminated, while
all below was in comparative darkness, and a light mist
floated over the lower regions. We were so fortunate
as to witness a phenomenon which is not always visible,
viz., the projection of the triangular shadow of the
mountain across the island, a hundred miles away.
The shadow appeared vertically suspended in space at or
beyond Palermo, and resting on a slightly misty atmosphere;
it gradually sank until it reached the surface of
the island, and as the sun rose it approached nearer and
nearer to the base of the mountain. In a short time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>the flood of light destroyed the first effects of light and
shadow. The mountains of Calabria and the west
coast of Italy appeared very close, and Stromboli and
the Lipari Islands almost under our feet; the east
coast of Sicily could be traced until it ended at Cape
Passaro and turned to the west, forming the southern
boundary of the island, while to the west distant
mountains appeared. No one would have the hardihood
to attempt to describe the various impressions which
rapidly float through the mind during the contemplation
of sunrise from the summit of Etna. Brydone, who is
by no means inclined to be rapturous or ecstatic in regard
to the many wonderful sights he saw in the course
of his tour, calls this "the most wonderful and most
sublime sight in nature." "Here," he adds, "description
must ever fall short, for no imagination has dared
to form an idea of so glorious and so magnificent a
scene. Neither is there on the surface of this globe
any one point that unites so many awful and sublime
objects. The immense elevation from the surface of
the earth, drawn as it were to a single point, without
any neighbouring mountains for the senses and imagination
to rest upon, and recover from their astonishment
in their way down to the world. This point or pinnacle,
raised on the brink of a bottomless gulph, as old as the
world, often discharging rivers of fire and throwing out
burning rocks with a noise that shakes the whole island.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>Add to this, the unbounded extent of the prospect, comprehending
the greatest diversity and the most beautiful
scenery in nature, with the rising sun advancing in the
east to illuminate the scene."</p>

<p>When the sun had risen we had time to examine the
crater, a vast abyss nearly 1000 feet in depth, and with
very precipitous sides. Its dimensions vary, but it is
now between two and three miles in circumference.
Sometimes it is nearly full of lava, at other times it
appears to be bottomless. At the present time it is like
an inverted cone; its sides are covered with incrustations
of sulphur and ammonia salts, and jets of steam perpetually
issue from crevices. Near the summit we found
a deposit, several inches in thickness, of a white substance,
apparently lava decomposed by the hot issuing
gases. Hydrochloric acid is said to frequently issue from
the crater; the gases that were most abundant appeared
to be sulphurous acid and steam. The interior of the
crater appeared to be very similar to that of the Solfatara
near Puzzuoli. During the descent from the cone we
collected various specimens of ash and cinder, some red,
others black and very vesicular, others crystalline, some
pale pink. The steep slope of the cone was well shown
by the fact that, although the surface is either extremely
rugged owing to the accumulation of masses of lava, or
soft and yielding on account of the depth of cinders, a
large mass of lava set rolling at the top rushes down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>with increasing velocity until it bounds off to the level
plain below.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 636px;">

<p class='caption'>View of the Val del Bove</p>
</div>

<p>The great cone is formed by the accumulation of sand,
scori&aelig;, and masses of rock ejected from the crater; it is
oval in form, and has varied both in shape and size in the
course of centuries. When we saw it, it was not full of
smoke or steam; but it was possible to see to the bottom
of it, in spite of small jets of steam which issued from
the sides. It presented the appearance of a profound
funnel-shaped abyss; the sides of which were covered
with an efflorescence of a red or yellow, and sometimes
nearly white, colour. The crater presented the same
appearance when it was seen by Captain Smyth in 1814,
but he was so fortunate as to witness it in a less quiescent
state. "While making these observations," he
writes, "on a sudden the ground trembled under our
feet, a harsh rumbling with sonorous thunder was heard,
and volumes of heavy smoke rolled over the side of the
crater, while a lighter one ascended vertically, with the
electric fluid escaping from it in frequent flashes in every
direction. . . . During some time the ground shook so
violently that we apprehended the whole cone would
tumble into the burning gulf (as it actually had done
several times before) and destroy us in the horrible
consequences; however, in less than a couple of hours
all was again clear above and quiet within." When Mr.
Gladstone ascended in 1838, the volcano was in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>slight state of eruption: "The great features of this
action," he writes, "are the sharp and loud claps,
which perceptibly shook from time to time the ground of
the mountain under our feet; the sheet of flame which
leapt up with a sudden momentary blast, and soon disappeared
in smoke; then the shower of red-hot stones
and lava. At this time, as we found on our way down,
lava masses of 150 or 200 pound weight were being
thrown a distance of probably a mile and a half; smaller
ones we found even more remote. These showers were
most copious, and often came in the most rapid succession.
Even while we were ascending the exterior of the cone,
we saw them alighting on its slope, and sometimes
bounding down with immense rapidity within, perhaps,
some thirty or forty yards of our rickety footing on
the mountain side. They dispersed like the sparks
of a rocket; they lay beneath the moon, over the
mountain, thicker than ever the stars in heaven; the
larger ones ascended as it were with deliberation, and
descended, first with speed and then with fury. Now
they passed even over our heads, and we could pick up
some newly fallen, and almost intolerably hot. Lastly,
there was the black grey column, which seemed smoke,
and was really ash, and which was shot from time to
time out of the very bowels of the crater, far above its
edge, in regular unbroken form."</p>

<p>At the Casa Inglesi we remounted the mules, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>made a slight detour to the east in order to look down
into the Val del Bove, which is here seen as a gigantic
valley, bounded on the north by the precipitous cliffs of
the Serra delle Concazze, and on the South by the Serra
del Solfizio. It is believed by Lyell and others that in
the Balzo di Trifoglietto, at which point the precipices
are most profound and abrupt, there was a second permanent
crater of eruption. The Torre del Filosofo, a
ruined tower, traditionally the observatory of Empedocles,
stands near the Casa Inglesi. Not far from this a great
deposit of ice was found in 1828. It was preserved from
melting by a layer of ashes and sand, which had covered
it, soon after its first existence, as a glacier: a stream of
lava subsequently flowed over the ashes, and completely
protected the ice; the non-conducting power of the ashes
prevented the lava from melting the ice. The snow
which falls on the mountain is stowed away in caves,
and used by the Sicilians during summer. A ship load
is also sent to Malta, and the Archbishop of Catania
derives a good deal of his income from the sale of Etna
snow.</p>

<p>During our descent from the mountain we were much
struck by the apparent nearness of the minor cones beneath
us, and of the villages at the base of the mountain.
They seemed to be painted on a vertical wall in front of
us, and although from ten to fifteen miles distant they
appeared to be almost within a stone's throw. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>curious effect, which has often been observed before, is
due to refraction. At the summit of Etna we have left
one-third of the atmosphere beneath us, and the air is
now pressing upon the surface of the earth with a weight
of ten pounds on the square inch, instead of the usual
fifteen pounds experienced at the level of the sea. In
looking towards the base of the mountain we are consequently
looking from a rarer to a denser medium; and
it is a law of optics, that when light passes from a
denser to a rarer medium it is refracted away from the
perpendicular, and thus the object, from which it
emanates, appears raised, and nearer to us than it really
is. The objects around Etna appear near to us and
raised vertically from the horizon for the same reason
that a stick plunged in water appears bent.</p>

<p>We reached Nicolosi again about noon, having left it
eighteen hours before. The ascent of the mountain,
although it does not involve much hard walking, is
somewhat trying on account of the extremes of temperature
which have to be endured. In the course of the
morning of our descent we had experienced a difference
equal to more than 40&deg; F. As to the ascent, you are
moving upwards nearly all night; you have six hours
of riding on a mule, some of it in a bitterly cold atmosphere;
you get very much heated by the final steep climb
of 1100 feet, and you find at the summit a piercing
wind; of course there is no shelter, and you sit down to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>wait for sunrise on cinders which are gently giving off
steam and sulphurous acid; the former condenses to
water as soon as it meets the cold air, and you find your
great coat, or the rug on which you have sat down,
speedily saturated with moisture.</p>

<p><br />We have before alluded to the fact that Etna is far
more thickly populated than any other part of Sicily or
Italy; in fact, more so than almost any equal area in
the world, of course excepting large cities and their
neighbourhood. This is due to the wonderful fertility
of the soil, the salubrity of the climate, and, on the
eastern base, to the proximity of a sea-coast indented
with excellent harbours. The habitable zone of Etna
is restricted to the <i>Regione Coltivata</i>, nevertheless some
of the towns on the north and west have a considerable
elevation; thus Bronte is 2,782 feet above the sea, and
Randazzo 2,718. All the principal towns are situated
on the base road of the mountain, which was indeed
constructed in order to connect them. Out of the sixty-four
towns and villages on the mountain, the following
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>are the most important: Catania, Aci Reale, Paterno,
Aderno, Bronte, Randazzo, Aci S. Antonio, Biancavilla,
Calatabiano, Giarre, Francavilla, Linguagrossa,
Licodia, Mascali, Misterbianco, Nicolosi, Pedara, Piedemonte,
Trecastagne, and Tremestieri.</p>

<p>On our return from the summit, we rested for awhile
at Nicolosi, and in the cool of the evening started to
make a <i>giro</i> of the mountain by way of the base road.
Descending by the Nicolosi road as far as Mascalucia,
we branched off to the west, and made for Paterno,
passing near the town of Belpasso, which was destroyed
by the earthquake of 1669, and subsequently erected
on a new site. It still contains more than 7,000 inhabitants,
although the district is extremely unhealthy.</p>

<p>Paterno, the second largest town on the flanks of Etna
after Catania and Aci Reale, stands in the very heart of
the Regione Coltivata, and possesses more than 16,000
inhabitants. According to Cluverius, it is the site of the
city of Hybla Major (<span title="Hybla Megal&ecirc;">'&prime;&Upsilon;&beta;&lambda;&alpha; &Mu;&epsilon;&gamma;&alpha;'&lambda;&eta;</span>), a Sikelian city
which was unsuccessfully attacked by the Athenians
soon after they first landed in Sicily. During the second
Punic War, the inhabitants went over to the Carthagenians,
but the city was speedily recovered by the
Romans. Pliny, Cicero, and Pausanias allude to it,
but its later history has not come down to us.
An altar was lately found in Paterno dedicated to
<i>Veneri Victrici Hyblensi</i>. Several towns in Sicily were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>called Hybla, probably&mdash;according to Pausanias&mdash;in
honour of a local deity. Paterno was founded by
Roger I. in 1073: it was once a feudal city of some
importance, and possessed a cathedral and castle, and
several large monasteries. Although much fallen to
decay, it still possesses a good deal of vitality, and the
population is on the increase.</p>

<p>On leaving Paterno the road turns to the North-west,
and passes through the village of Ste. Maria di Licodia.
Here originally stood the Sikelian City of Inessa
(<span title="In&ecirc;ssa">&Iota;&eta;&epsilon;&sigma;&sigma;&alpha;</span>), which, after the death of Hiero I., was
peopled by colonists from Katana (then called <span title="Aitn&ecirc;">&Alpha;&iota;&theta;&nu;&eta;</span>).
The new occupants of the city changed its name from
Inessa to Aetna, which it retained. The town later fell
into the hands of the Syracusans, and in 462 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the
Athenians in vain attempted to take it. During the
Athenian expedition both Aetna and Hybla were allies
of Syracuse. In 403 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Aetna was taken by Dionysius,
who placed in it a body of Campanian mercenaries.
Sixty-four years later (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 339) the town was taken
by Timoleon. For many succeeding years we find no
further mention of it. Cicero speaks of it in his time
as an important place, and the centre of a very fertile
district; it is also mentioned by Pliny and Ptolemy,
and Strabo says that it was usually the starting point
for those who ascended the mountain. Of its later
history we know absolutely nothing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>Six miles to the north-west of St. Mariah di Licodia,
the road passes through Biancavilla&mdash;a town of 13,000
inhabitants, and the centre of a cotton district.</p>

<p>The road continues in the same direction until the
town of Aderno is reached; and here we arrived late
in the evening, and gained our first experience of a
Sicilian inn in an out-of-the-way town. After many
enquiries we were directed to the only inn which the
place could boast, kept by a doctor. No one appeared
at or near the entrance, of course there was no bell or
knocker, and we made our way up a dark stone staircase
till we arrived at a dimly-lighted passage. A horrible
old Sicilian woman now appeared, and showed us with
great incivility the only room in the house, which its
inmates were willing to place at our disposal. It was
a fairly large room, with a stone floor which apparently
had not been swept for weeks, and walls that had once
been whitewashed; the furniture consisted of three beds
placed on tressels, a plain deal table, and some primitive
chairs. As to food they had neither bread, meat, wine,
eggs, macaroni, fruit, or butter in the house; neither
did they offer to procure anything. Even when some
eggs had been obtained, and (after an hour's delay)
cooked, there was not a single teaspoon to eat them
with. The people of the town appear to subsist chiefly
on beans and a kind of dried fish. If our courier had
not been a very handy fellow and a tolerable cook, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>should have been obliged more than once to go to bed
supperless. As it was, the best he could do on this
occasion was to get some bread, eggs, and wine, and&mdash;best
of all&mdash;some snow, for the heat was intolerable.
In a town of the same size&mdash;15,657 inhabitants&mdash;in
England, we should have at least two really comfortable
inns ready at any moment to receive and entertain the
weary traveller.</p>

<p class='caption'>View of Etna from Bronte</p>
</div>

<p>Aderno stands on the site, and has preserved the
name, of the ancient Sikelian city of Adranum (<span title="Adranon">&Alpha;&delta;&rho;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&nu;</span>).
According to Diodorus there existed here, from very
early times, the temple of a local deity named Adranus.
The city was founded by the elder Dionysius in 400
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>; it owed its importance to the renown of its temple,
which was guarded by a thousand dogs. In 345 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
the city fell into the hands of Timoleon, and it was
taken by the Romans at the commencement of the first
Punic War. After this we cease to hear of it. The
modern town was founded by Roger I. in the 12th
century. The fine Norman tower&mdash;now used as a
prison&mdash;and the monastery, were both built by King
Roger.</p>

<p>After leaving Aderno the base-road ascends, turns
nearly due north, and leads us past a number of lava
streams, notably those of 1610, 1603, and 1651. A
good view of Monte Minardo, and the minor cones in
its more immediate neighbourhood, is obtained on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>left, while on the right we see the Valley of the Simeto,
and Centorbi high upon the hills.</p>

<p>Nearly due west of the great crater is the town of
Bronte, which is 2,782 feet above the sea, and has a
population of more than 15,000. It is a very primitive
place, and several centuries behind the age; it reminded
us forcibly, in one or two particulars, of Pompeii: the
streets are narrow and tortuous, and the roadway very
uneven. Awnings are sometimes hung across the street
from side to side to provide shade. The shops are
exactly like those at Pompeii; and in the main street
we noticed an open-air kitchen, to which the would-be
diner repairs, purchases a plateful of food, and eats
it standing in the public way. The inn was even
worse than that of Aderno, and apparently had never
before received guests. We were offered one miserable
room, without a lock to the door, and unprovided with
either table or chair. Of course the bare idea of offering
to procure, or furnish, or cook, any kind of food was
too monstrous to be entertained for a moment. With
difficulty the courier obtained some eggs, macaroni, and
fruit, on which we dined in a small barn attached to a
wine-shop.</p>

<p>At Bronte we are only nine miles from the crater, on
the steepest side of the mountain, and near the Tertiary
sandstone which underlies this portion of the mountain.
A short distance outside the town we saw great beds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>of the lava of 1832, piled up fantastically in all sorts
of forms, and excessively rugged and uneven. It is
quite bare of vegetation, and does not appear to have
even commenced to be decomposed.</p>

<p>Bronte gave its name to Lord Nelson, who was
created Duke of Bronte by Ferdinand IV.:&mdash;an appropriate
name for a great warrior (<span title="bront&ecirc;">&beta;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&eta;'</span>, thunder). The
Nelson estates are scattered around the town.</p>

<p>On leaving Bronte the road conducted us past several
high hills of sandstone and quartzite near Monte
Rivoglia; then we passed near Maletto, and, leaving
the malarious lake Gurrita on our left, we soon after
arrived at Randazzo. Near Maletto the road reaches
it highest point&mdash;3,852 feet.</p>

<p>The town of Randazzo was founded by the Lombards
in the 10th century; during the Middle Ages it appears
to have been a prosperous, populous, place; at present it
possesses more than 8,000 inhabitants. The Emperor
Frederick II. created his son Duke of Randazzo, and
added to the name of the town, <i>Etnea</i>. It contains
several very interesting architectural remains; a church
of the 13th century, a medi&aelig;val palace&mdash;the Palazzo
Finochiaro,&mdash;and a ducal palace now used as a prison.
The houses are for the most part built of lava, and some
of the shops have massive lava counters extending half
across their open front, while the door occupies the
remainder, as at Pompeii. The view from Randazzo is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>very fine in every direction; the crater of Etna appears
near, and Monte Spagnuolo&mdash;many hours distant&mdash;just
outside the town. The town is 2,718 feet above the
sea, just above the Valley of the Alcantara&mdash;of which
it commands a fine view, and also of the limestone hills
on the other side.</p>

<p>We were obliged to pass the night in the town, in an
inn scarcely superior to that of Aderno, but distinctly
better than the miserable Albergo Collegio at Bronte.
At least the people were civil, and did their best. The
one room of the inn had a bed in each corner, and a
deal table in the middle. Three of the beds were
occupied by engineers who were surveying in connection
with a new line of railway; the fourth was made over
to the courier. I slept in a small kind of ante-room on
a bed chiefly composed of deal boards placed on tressels.
Here again the courier was invaluable, in fact it would
be simply impossible to make the circuit of Etna without
a courier. He procured some eggs, macaroni, fruit,
snow, tomatoes, and even meat, and cooked everything
well, without a trace of garlic. He also took care that
the linen was clean, and the general arrangements as
comfortable as they could be under the circumstances.
Let us also admit that neither at Aderno, Bronte, nor
Randazzo were we troubled with musquitoes or any
worse species of insect. These, we were assured, would
appear in full force in the following month (September).
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>Our only inconvenience of this nature arose from swarms
of flies. The inns of these out-of-the-way towns probably
receive scarcely a dozen travellers in the year, and these
are Sicilians, who are not used to better accommodation.
Evidently a <i>forestiare</i> is quite a novelty: the people of
these small towns used to look at us with great curiosity,
and crowded round the carriage when we started. At
Bronte we had a good example of this curiosity: owing
to the hardness of the lava of 1832 the head had come
off the handle of our hammer, and we went into a
carpenter's shop to have it put on again. Presently we
noticed that eleven people, including a priest, were
looking on, apparently with intense and absorbing
interest.</p>

<p>From Randazzo the base-road descends, until at
Giarre it is near the sea-level. This road is one of the
most beautiful in Sicily; it is part of the old military
route from Messina to Palermo, and it was traversed
by Himilco in 396 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>; by Timoleon in 344 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>; and
by Charles V. in 1534. After leaving Randazzo the
valley of the Alcantara becomes visible, while beyond
it rise the lofty mountains of the Nebrodes. The road
passes near Monte Dolce, and soon reaches Linguaglossa,
a small town from whence the craters of 1865 may be
reached in about four hours. The rapidly descending
road passes through Piedemonte and Mascali, in the
heart of an extraordinarily fertile region. Mascali, a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>village of 3050 inhabitants, was considered by Cluverius
to be the site of the Greek town of Callipolis, founded
by a colony from Naxos as early as the fifth century,
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> A full view of the coast line is obtained from
the Capo di Taormina on the north, to a point below
Riposto on the south. We descended through plantations
of nuts, and groves of oranges and lemons, to
gentle slopes covered with vineyards.</p>

<p>From the town of Giarre, (17,965 inhabitants), we
get a view of the Val del Bove, which, however, is
almost always obscured by thin white clouds, while
the summit of the mountain is clear. We noticed,
indeed, every day that the summit, which had been
absolutely clear all the day and night, became covered
with clouds shortly before sunset, while about an
hour later the clouds cleared off, and the mountain
was sharply defined against the sky during the starlit
night. Some of the effects of sunset behind clouds
resting on the summit, while all the rest of the sky was
bright blue, were exceedingly beautiful, and were quite
untranslatable into any known language, save that of
painting, and of music. Perhaps Turner could have
done justice to them.</p>

<p>After leaving Giarre we passed through a good deal
of highly cultivated land belonging to Baron Pennisi,
the largest landholder and richest man in Sicily. He
makes good use of his wealth, and seems to be very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>popular among all classes. He possesses three palaces
in Aci Reale, and has done a great deal to beautify
the town. Arch&aelig;ologists will remember him as the
possessor of the finest collection of Sicilian coins in
the world. Many of these have been found on his own
estates, but he never scruples to give large sums of
money for any coin which he covets.</p>

<p>Aci Reale, one of the prettiest towns in Europe,
is situated in the midst of a very fertile region 550
feet above the sea. To the east it faces the Ionian
sea, while on the west towers Etna. The town is
full of wealthy inhabitants, and the houses are large,
lofty, and well built. It contains 24,151 inhabitants,
and possesses celebrated sulphur baths, and one of the
best hotels in Sicily. The wealth of this small town
is well shown by the following fact: Since its foundation
in the tenth century, till within a year or two
of the present time, the town had been under the
jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Catania. It happened,
however, a few years ago, on the occasion of a religious
procession in Catania, that the people of Aci considered
that their patron Saint, S. Venera, was slighted. In
fact the image of S. Agata, the patron Saint of the
Catanese&mdash;whose veil has so often averted the lava-streams
from the city&mdash;was put in all the prominent
parts of the procession, while the image of S. Venera
was comparatively neglected. The people of Aci at once
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>returned home, and sent a petition to the Pope,
praying that they might have a Bishop of their own
directly subject to the Holy See, in order that they
might no longer be subjected to such slights. The
Vatican having duly considered the question consented
to raise Aci to the dignity of a Bishopric, and to pay
the Bishop a yearly stipend of 10,000 lire, (about
&pound;400, but equal to &pound;600 in Sicily), on condition that
200,000 lire were paid at once into the coffers of the
Vatican. This was promptly done, and now Monsignore
Gerlando Genuardi, Bishop of Aci Reale, may
snap his fingers in the face of Monsignore Giuseppe
Benedetto Dusmet, a Benedictine of the Congregation of
Monte Cassino, and Archbishop of Catania.</p>

<p>Six villages in the neighbourhood of Aci Reale bear
the name of Aci: Aci Castello, Aci Sant' Antonio,
and so on, but Aci Reale claims to stand upon the
very site rendered memorable by the story of Acis
and Galatea. The river Acis (now called <i>Acque
Grande</i>) rises from a bed of lava, and falls into the
sea a mile from its source. Aci Reale stands on
seven different beds of superposed lava, having layers
of earth resulting from decomposed lava between. The
Canon Recupero calculated from observation, that a
lava requires at least 2000 years to form even a
scanty layer of earth, consequently he inferred that
the lowest of the lava streams upon which Aci rests
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>must have been formed 14,000 years ago. These
views he stated to Brydone a hundred years ago;
the latter says, "Recupero tells me he is exceedingly
embarrassed by these discoveries in writing the history
of the mountain. That Moses hangs like a dead
weight upon him, and blunts all his zeal for enquiry;
for that really he has not the conscience to make his
mountain so young as that prophet makes the world.
What do you think of these sentiments from a Roman
Catholic Divine? The Bishop, who is strenuously
orthodox&mdash;for it is an excellent See&mdash;has already
warned him to be upon his guard, and not to pretend
to be a better natural historian than Moses; not
to presume to urge anything that may, in the smallest
degree, be deemed contradictory to his sacred authority."
The Canon Recupero lost his church preferment on
the publication of Brydone's book, and the whole body
of clergy of Girgenti received a reprimand on account
of a capital story which Brydone told of a dinner at
which the Bishop presided, during which several of
the reverend Canons suffered severely from the effects
of English punch, which Brydone had brewed for them.
We quite agree with Admiral Smyth when he says,
"It is a pity that Mr. Brydone laboured under such
a cacoethes, as to sacrifice a friend for the sake of a
good story." Of course we now know that Recupero's
estimate of the age of Etna was far within the true
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>limits, but we derive this information from other
sources. No true estimate can be obtained from the
observation of the decomposition of lavas, for it has
been often observed that two lavas will decompose at
very different rates.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<a name="Island_of_Columnar_Basalt" id="Island_of_Columnar_Basalt"></a><img src="images/fp074.jpg" width="700" height="339" alt="" title="" />
<p class='caption'>Island of Columnar Basalt off Trezza</p>
</div>

<p>A little to the north of the village of La Scaletta,
at the base of the rocks upon which Aci Reale stands,
there are two small caverns in the abrupt face of
the basalt, which can only be approached in a boat.
They consist of columnar basalt bent very curiously, and
capped by amorphous basalt.</p>

<p>A drive of a few miles to the South of Aci Reale
brings us to Trezza, a small village built of lava. A
short distance from the shore are the celebrated <i>Scogli
di Ciclopi</i>, or rocks of the Cyclops, said to be those
which Polyphemus hurled at Ulysses after his escape
from the cave. The rocks, seven in number, form
small islets, the largest of which, the Isola d'Aci, is
about 3000 feet in circumference, and 150 feet high.
It consists of crudely columnar basalt capped by
a kind of marl. Near the top of the island there is
a cave called the "Grotto of Polyphemus," also a
cistern of water. To the south of this island a very
picturesque rock rises from the sea. It is 2000 feet in
circumference and about 200 feet in height, and consists
of columnar basalt in four and eight-sided prisms,
but not very regular; a hard calcareous substance is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>found in their interstices. Fine crystals of analcime
are sometimes met with in the basalts of the Cyclops
Islands. Lyell considers these basalts "the most ancient
monuments of volcanic action within the region of Etna."</p>

<p>A few miles south of the Isole di Ciclopi are the
bay and city of Catania. We started from the latter
when we commenced our ascent of Etna, and now on
returning to it, we completed the circuit of the mountain
by its base-road of 87 miles.</p>

<p>Katana (<span title="Katan&ecirc;">&Kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;'&nu;&eta;</span>) is believed to have been founded
about 730 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> by a Greek colony of Naxos, which had
originally come from Chalcis. The city maintained its
independence till the time of Hieron, who expelled the
original inhabitants in 476 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and peopled the city
with Syracusans and inhabitants of the Peloponnesus
to the number of 10,000. At the same time the name
of the city was changed to Aetna (<span title="Aitn&ecirc;">&prime;'&Alpha;&iota;&theta;&nu;&eta;</span>). In 461 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
however, the old inhabitants retook their city, and drove
out the newly-settled strangers, who betook themselves
to Inessa, occupied it, and changed its name to <i>Aetna</i>.
At a later period the Katanians sided with the Athenians
against the Syracusans. But in 403 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Dionysius of
Syracuse took and plundered the city, sold the inhabitants
as slaves, and established in it a body of Campanian
mercenaries. The latter quitted it and retired to Aetna
in 396 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when the city was taken by the Carthaginians
after a battle off the rocks of the Cyclops.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>Katana submitted to the Romans in 263 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, during the
first Punic War, and it soon became a very populous city.
Cicero mentions it as a wealthy city and important
seaport. During the Middle Ages it underwent many
changes both at the hands of nature and of man; it
belonged in succession to the Goths, Saracens, and
Normans; and in 1169 was destroyed by an earthquake,
during which 15,000 of its inhabitants perished. Again
in 1669, and 1693, it was almost destroyed by earthquakes.
The present town is comparatively new, many
of its more ancient remains are covered with lava,
among them the remains of a fine Greco-Roman theatre,
in which it is probable that Alcibiades addressed the
Catanians in 415 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> There are also remains of a
Roman amphitheatre, bath, and tombs. Of more modern
structures, the cathedral is the first to claim our notice.
It was commenced by Roger I. in 1091, but in less than
a century was almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake.
At one corner of the building you descend
through a narrow passage cut in the lava, to a crypt
in which some ancient Roman arches are shown,
partly filled up with lava. Here also is seen a small
stream of very clear water flowing through the lava.
The cathedral contains several interesting tombs, and
in the chapel of S. Agata, her body is preserved in a
silver sarcophagus, which during certain fetes is carried
through the town in procession, attended by all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>authorities. S. Agata was martyred by the Pr&aelig;tor
Quintianus in the reign of Decius, and is the patron
saint of the city. Whenever Catania has been in trouble
from the approach of lava streams, or from earthquakes,
the veil of S. Agata has been used as a charm to avert
the evil.</p>

<p>The University of Catania is the most celebrated in
Sicily. It was founded in 1445 by Alfonso of Arragon,
and has produced several men of eminence. The city
also possesses one of the finest monasteries in the world,
now converted into schools and barracks. Formerly the
monastery of S. Nicola was occupied by 40 monks, all
members of noble families; it is sufficiently large to hold
400.</p>

character of the Eruptions.</small></p>

<p><br />A list of all the eruptions of Etna from the earliest
times has been given by several writers, notably by
Ferrara in his <i>Descrizione dell' Etna</i>, and by Gemellaro.
The latter places the first eruption in 1226 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> in the
time of the Sicani; the second in 1170 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>; and of the
third he says, "In 1149 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> there was an eruption, and
Hercules in consequence fled from the island." Of
course these dates are worthless, and the statements are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>no doubt based upon the assertion of Diodorus, that
before the Trojan war the Sicani were driven from the
east side of Sicily by the eruptions of the volcano.</p>

<ol><li>The first eruption appears to have occurred in the
time of Pythagoras; we have no details as to its nature.</li>

<li>The second eruption occurred in 477 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> It is
mentioned by Thucydides, and it must be the eruption
to which Pindar and &AElig;schylus allude.  The former
visited the tomb of Hiero I. of Syracuse in 473 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and
the latter was in Sicily in 471 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> On the occasion of
this eruption, two heroic youths named An&#259;pias and
Amph&#301;nomus, performed a deed to which Seneca and
other writers allude with enthusiasm. While the lava
was rapidly overwhelming the city of Katana, they
placed their aged parents on their shoulders, and, at the
risk of their lives, bore them through the flaming streets,
and succeeded in placing them in safety. It was said
that the fiery stream of lava parted to make way for
them.  Statues were raised to the honour of the <i>Pii
Fratres</i>, and their burial place was long known as the
<i>Campus Piorum</i>. Even a temple was erected to commemorate
the deed.<br /><br />

Lucilius Junior devotes the concluding lines of his
poem on Etna to the glory of the brothers: "The
flames blushed to touch the filial youths, and wherever
they plant their footsteps, they retire. That day is a
day of fortune; harmless that land. On their right hand
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>fierce dangers prevail; on their left are burning fires.
Athwart the flames they pass in triumph, his brother
and he, each safe beneath his filial burden. There the
devouring fire flees backward, and checks itself round the
twin pair. At length they issue forth unharmed, and
bear with them their deities in safety. Songs of poets
honour and admire them; them has Pluto placed apart
beneath a glorious name, nor can the mean Fates reach
the holy youths, but have truly granted them the homes
and dominion of the blessed."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></li>

<li>The third eruption occurred in the year 426 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
It is mentioned by Thucydides as having commenced in
the sixth year of the Peloponnesian War. It destroyed
a portion of the territory of the inhabitants of Katana.</li>

<li>An important eruption occurred in the year 396
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> It broke out from Monte di Mojo, the most
northerly of the minor cones of Etna, and following
the course of the river Acesines, (now the Alcantara)
entered the sea at the site of the ancient Greek colony
of Naxos. Himilco the Carthaginian general, was at
this time on his way from Messana to Syracuse, and he
was compelled to march his troops round the west side
of the mountain in order to avoid the stream of lava.</li>

<li>We hear of no further eruption for 256 years,
when in the year 140 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, in the consulship of C. L&aelig;lius
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>Sapiens and Q. Servilius C&aelig;pio, there was an outburst
from the volcano which destroyed 40 people.</li>

<li>Six years later an eruption occurred according to
Orosius and Julius Obsequens, in the consulship of
Sergius Fulvius Flaccus, and Quintus Calpurnius Piso.
We have no details concerning its nature or extent.</li>

<li>The same authorities state that in the year 126 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
in the consulship of L. &OElig;milius Lepidus, and L. Aurelius
Orestes, Sicily suffered from a very severe earthquake,
and a deluge of fiery matter poured from Etna, overwhelming
large tracts of country, and rendering the
waters of the adjacent Ionian sea positively hot. It is
said that the sea near the island of Lipari boiled, and
that the inhabitants ate so large a number of the fishes
which were cast, already cooked, upon their shores, that
a distemper appeared which destroyed a large number of
people.</li>

<li>Four years later Katana was nearly destroyed by
a new eruption. The roofs of many of the houses were
broken in by the weight of hot ashes which fell upon
them; but the lava stream turned aside near the city
and flowed into the sea. The lava is believed to have
issued from a small crater near Gravina, about 2&frac12;
miles from Katana. The city was so much injured
by this eruption that the Romans granted the inhabitants
an immunity from all taxes for a space of ten
years.</li>

<li><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>An eruption, of which we have no details, occurred
during the civil war between C&aelig;sar and Pompey.</li>

<li>Livy speaks of an eruption and earthquake which
took place shortly before the death of C&aelig;sar, which it
was believed to portend.</li>

<li>In 38 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, during the civil war between Octavianus
and Sextus Pompeius, a violent eruption
occurred on the east side of the mountain, accompanied
by fearful noises and outbursts of flame.</li>

<li>Six years afterwards an eruption of a less violent
character took place.</li>

<li>The next eruption of which we hear is that
mentioned by Suetonius in his Life of Caligula. The
Emperor happened to be at Messina at the time, and he
fled from the town through fear of the eruption. This
was in 40 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></li>

<li>An eruption is said to have occurred in 72,
in the second year after the capture of Jerusalem by
Titus.</li>

<li>Etna was now quiescent for nearly two centuries,
but in the year 253, in the reign of the Emperor Decius,
a violent eruption lasting nine days occurred. The lava
flowed in the direction of Catania, and the inhabitants
for the first time tested the efficacy of the veil of S.
Agatha, which afterwards stood them in such good
stead on more than one occasion. The Saint had been
martyred the year before, and when the frightened
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>inhabitants saw the stream of lava approaching the
city, they rushed to the tomb, and removed the veil
which covered her body. This was carried to the edge
of the descending torrent of lava, and is asserted to have
at once arrested its progress.</li>

<li>According to Carrera and Photius an eruption
occurred in the year 420.</li>

<li>We now find no record of any volcanic action for
nearly four hundred years. Geoffrey of Viterbo states
that an eruption occurred in 812, when Charlemagne
was in Messina.</li>

<li>After another long interval of more than three
centuries and a half, the mountain again entered into
eruption.  In February, 1169, occurred one of the
most disastrous eruptions on record. A violent earthquake,
which was felt as far as Reggio, occurred about
dawn, and in a few minutes Catania was a heap of
ruins. It is estimated that 15,000 persons were buried
beneath the ruins. It was the vigil of the feast of S.
Agatha, and the Cathedral of Catania was crowded with
people, who were all buried beneath the ruins, together
with the Bishop and forty-four Benedictine monks. The
side of the cone of the great crater towards Taormina
fell into the crater. At Messina the sea retired to some
distance from the shore, and then suddenly returned,
overwhelming a portion of the city, and sweeping away
a number of persons who had fled to the shore for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>safety. The clear and pure fountain of Arethusa at
Syracuse became muddy and brackish; while the fountain
of Ajo, near the village of Saraceni, ceased to flow
for two hours, and then emitted water of the colour of
blood. Ludovico Aurelio states that the vines, corn,
and trees were burnt up over large districts.</li>

<li>According to Nicolo Speziale, there was a great
eruption from the eastern side of the mountain in
1181.</li>

<li>A stream of lava is said to have burst from the
eastern side of the mountain in 1285, when Charles of
Anjou was on his death-bed, and to have flowed fifteen
miles.</li>

<li>In the year 1329 Niccolo Speziale was in Catania,
and witnessed the eruption of which he has left us an
account. On the evening of June 28th, about the hour
of vespers, Etna was strongly convulsed, terrible noises
were emitted, and flames issued from the south side of
the mountain. A new crater&mdash;Monte Lepre&mdash;opened in
the Val del Bove above the rock of Musarra, and
emitted large quantities of dense black smoke. Soon
afterwards a torrent of lava poured from the crater,
and red-hot masses of rock were projected into the air.
These effects continued till the 15th of July, when a
second crater opened ten miles to the S.E. of Montelepre,
and near the Church of S. Giovanni Paparometto. Soon
after four other craters opened around it, and emitted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>smoke and lava. The sun was obscured from morning
till evening by the smoke and ashes, and the adjacent
fields were burnt up by the hot sand and ashes. Multitudes
of birds and animals perished, and many persons
are said to have died from terror. The lava streams
were divided into three portions, two of which flowed
towards Aci, and the third towards Catania. The ashes
were carried as far as Malta, a distance of 130 miles.</li>

<li>Four years afterwards an eruption is recorded by
Silvaggio.</li>

<li>A manuscript preserved in the archives of the
Cathedral of Catania mentions an eruption which occurred
on the 6th of August, 1371, which caused the
destruction of numerous olive groves near the city.</li>

<li>An eruption which lasted for twelve days commenced
on the 9th of November, 1408; it originated
in the great crater, but several mouths subsequently
opened near the base of the mountain. Large quantities
of red-hot ashes were emitted, some of which fell in
Calabria. The villages of Pedara and Tre Castagne
suffered severely from this eruption.</li>

<li>A violent earthquake in 1444 caused the upper
cone of the mountain to fall into the crater. A torrent
of lava also issued from the mountain, and moved for
a space of twenty days towards Catania, but it did not
reach the city.</li>

<li>Two years later lava issued from the Val del
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>Bove near the Rock of Musarra; the crater then formed
was perhaps the present Monte Finocchio.</li>

<li>A short eruption, of which we have no details,
occurred in 1447: after which Etna was quiescent for 89
years.</li>

<li>Bembo and Fazzello mention an eruption which
occurred towards the close of the 15th century, during
which a current of lava flowed from the great crater,
and destroyed a portion of Catania. In 1533 Filoteo, of
whom we have before spoken as one of the earliest historians
of Etna, descended into the crater, which possessed
its present funnel-like form. He found at the bottom a
hole, not larger than a man's head, from which issued a
thin moist sulphurous vapour.</li>

<li>In March, 1536, a quantity of lava issued from
the great crater, and several new apertures opened near
the summit of the mountain and emitted lava. It
divided into several streams, flowing in different directions,
one towards Randazzo, a second towards Aderno,
and a third towards Bronte. The lava swept everything
before it; at the same time quantities of smoke and
ashes were ejected, the mountain was convulsed, and
fearful noises were heard.  Three new craters were
formed on the south and west sides of the mountain, and
on the 26th of March twelve new craters, or <i>bocche</i>,
opened between Monte Manfre and Monte Vituri. A
physician of Lentini, named Negro di Piazza, having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>approached too near to the scene of the eruption, was
destroyed by a volley of red-hot stones. Several rifts
were formed in the sides of the mountain from which
issued flames and hot cinders.</li>

<li>A year later, in May, 1537, a fresh outburst
occurred; a number of new mouths were opened on the
south slope of the mountain near La Fontanelle, and a
quantity of lava was emitted, which flowed in the
direction of Catania, destroying a part of Nicolosi, and
S. Antonio. In four days the lava had run fifteen
miles. At the same time violent shocks of earthquake
occurred all over Sicily, the inhabitants thought that
the last day had come, and many prepared for their end
by receiving Extreme Unction. According to Filoteo
the noises were so violent that many persons were
struck deaf. The sun was obscured by smoke and dust,
ashes fell in sufficient quantities to destroy the olive
plantations of Messina, and were even carried 300 miles
out to sea. The great crater suddenly fell in, so as to
become level with the Piano del Lago. The height of
the mountain was thus diminished by 320 feet.</li>

<li>Three new craters opened in November, 1566,
on the north-east slope of the mountain. Quantities
of lava were emitted, which flowed towards Linguaglossa
and Randazzo.</li>

<li>A slight eruption, of which we have no details,
occurred in 1579.</li>

<li><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>According to Carrera, an eruption occurred in
June, 1603. The mountain was shaken with earthquakes,
and great volumes of smoke and flame were
emitted.</li>

<li>A stream of lava issued from the great crater
four years later, and filled up the lake which had
previously existed in the Piano del Lago.</li>

<li>In February, 1610, lava was emitted from the
great crater. It flowed towards Aderno, and filled up
the bed of the Simeto, a little above the Ponte di
Carcaci. A few months later a second stream destroyed
a large portion of the forest Del Pino.</li>

<li>In 1614 several new craters were opened between
Randazzo and the great crater on the north side of the
mountain. A quantity of lava issued from them, which
united into one stream, and ran for ten miles, destroying
a great deal of wooded country.</li>

<li>A slight eruption occurred in 1619.</li>

<li>In February, 1633, Nicolosi was partially destroyed
by a violent earthquake; and in the following
December earthquakes became frequent on the mountain.
A new crater opened above the cone called Serrapizzuta,
five miles from the great crater, and emitted a good
deal of lava. A second crater afterwards opened about
two miles to the east of the former. The eruption
lasted off and on for four years: the ejected lava then
covered a tract eighteen miles in length by two miles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>in width, the thickness sometimes attaining 42 feet.
In 1643 a severe earthquake occurred, which was mainly
felt on the west side of the mountain.</li>

<li>In 1646 a new mouth opened on the north-north-east
side of the mountain, five miles from the great
crater. The lava flowed towards Castiglione.</li>

<li>In February, 1651, several new mouths opened
on the west side of the mountain, and poured out vast
volumes of lava which threatened to overwhelm Bronte.
In twenty-four hours the lava ran sixteen miles with a
breadth of four miles.</li>

<li>We have a more detailed account of the eruption
of 1669 than of any previous outburst. It was observed
by many men of different nations; and we find accounts
of it in our own <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, in French,
and of course in Italian. Perhaps the most accurate
and complete description is that given by Alfonso
Borelli, Professor of Mathematics in Catania. The
eruption was, in every respect, one of the most terrible
on record. On the 8th of March the sun was obscured,
and a whirlwind blew over the face of the mountain;
at the same time earthquakes commenced, and continued
to increase in violence for three days, when
Nicolosi was converted into a heap of ruins. On the
morning of the 11th a fissure nearly twelve miles in
length opened in the side of the mountain, and
extended from the Piano di S. Leo to Monte Frumento,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>a mile from the summit. The fissure was only six
feet wide, but it seemed to be of unknown depth, and
a bright light proceeded from it. Six mouths opened
in a line with the principal fissure; they emitted vast
columns of smoke, accompanied by loud bellowings
which could be heard 40 miles off. Towards the close
of the day, a crater opened about a mile below the
others, and it ejected red hot stones to a considerable
distance, and afterwards sand and ashes which covered
the country for a distance of 60 miles. The new crater
soon vomited forth a torrent of lava which presented
a front of two miles, it encircled Monpilieri, and afterwards
flowed towards Belpasso, a town of 8000 inhabitants,
which was speedily destroyed. Seven mouths
of fire opened around the new crater, and in three days
united with it, forming one large crater 800 feet in
diameter. The torrent of lava all this time continued
to descend, and it destroyed the town of Mascalucia on
the 23rd of March. On the same day the crater cast
up great quantities of sand, ashes, and scori&aelig;, and
formed above itself the great double-coned hill now
called Monti Rossi from the red colour of the ashes of
which it is mainly composed. On the 25th very violent
earthquakes occurred, and the cone of the great central
crater was shaken down into the crater for the fifth
time since the first century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> The original current
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>of lava had divided into three streams, one of which
destroyed S. Pietro, the second Camporotondo, and
the third the lands about Mascalucia, and afterwards
the village of Misterbianco. Fourteen villages were
altogether destroyed, and the lava was on its way to
Catania. At Albanelli, two miles from the city, it
undermined a hill covered with cornfields, and carried
it forward a considerable distance; a vineyard was also
seen to be floating on its fiery surface. When the lava
reached the walls of Catania it accumulated without
progression until it rose to the top of the wall, 60 feet
in height, and it then fell over in a fiery cascade, and
overwhelmed a part of the city. Another portion of the
same stream threw down 120 feet of the wall, and
flowed into the city. On the 23rd of April the lava
reached the sea, which it entered as a stream 600 yards
broad and 40 feet deep. The stream had moved at the
rate of thirteen miles in twenty days, but as it cooled
it moved less quickly, and during the last twenty-three
days of its course it only moved two miles. On reaching
the sea the water of course began to boil violently, and
clouds of steam arose, carrying with them particles of
scori&aelig;. Towards the end of April the stream on the
west side of Catania, which had appeared to be consolidated,
again burst forth, and flowed into the garden
of the Benedictine Monastery of S. Niccola, and then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>branched off into the city. Attempts were made to
build walls to arrest its progress. An attempt of another
kind was made by a gentleman of Catania, named
Pappalardo, who took fifty men with him, having
previously provided them with skins for protection from
the intense heat, and with crowbars to effect an opening
in the lava. They pierced the solid outer crust of
solidified lava, and a rivulet of the molten interior
immediately gushed out, and flowed in the direction of
Paterno; whereupon 500 men of that town, alarmed for
its safety, took up arms, and caused Pappalardo and his
men to desist. The lava did not altogether stop for
four months; and two years after it had ceased to flow
it was found to be red hot beneath the surface.
Even eight years after the eruption quantities of steam
escaped from the lava after a shower of rain. The
stones which were ejected from the crater during this
eruption were often of considerable magnitude, and
Borelli calculated that the diameter of one which he
saw was 50 feet; it was thrown to a distance of a mile,
and as it fell it penetrated the earth to a depth of
23 feet. The volume of lava emitted during this eruption
amounted to many millions of cubic feet: Ferrara
considers that the length of the stream was at least
fifteen miles, while its average width was between two
and three miles, so that it covered at least forty square
miles of surface.<br /><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>In a somewhat rare tract,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Lord Winchelsea, who
was returning to England from Constantinople, and who
landed at Catania, gives an account of what he saw of
the eruption. He appears to have been frightened at
the sight, and took good care to keep in a safe place;
hence his letter, which is a short one, is mainly founded
on hearsay. However, he says, "I could discern the
river of fire to descend the mountain, of a terrible fiery
or red colour, and stones of a paler red to swim thereon,
and to be as big as an ordinary table.... Of 20,000
persons which inhabited Catania, 3000 did only remain;
all their goods are carried away, the cannon of brass
are removed out of the castle, some great bells taken
down, the city gates walled up next the fire, and
preparations made by all to abandon the city." The
noble earl is less happy in his scientific ideas than in
his general statement of the facts of which he was an eye-witness;
we can only hope that he joined the recently-formed
Royal Society on his return to England, and
listened to Robert Hooke's discourse on fire. In
describing the lava, Lord Winchelsea says, "The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>composition of this fire, stones, and cinders, are sulphur,
nitre, quicksilver, sal-ammoniac, lead, iron, brass, and
all other mettals!" Two other accounts are appended
to the above letter; in one of these we are told that
as the lava approached Catania, the various religious
bodies carried their relics in procession, "followed by
great multitudes of people, some of them mortifying
themselves with whips, and other signs of penance,
with great complaints and cries, expressing their dreadful
expectation of the events of those prodigious fiery inundations."
In the midst of all this, news was brought
that a large band of robbers had taken advantage of the
general distress, and were robbing right and left, and
murdering the people: whereupon a troop of Spanish
horse was sent out to protect the city and country, three
pair of gallows were set up, and such as were found
robbing were executed without trial by martial
law.<br /><br />

As the lava streams approached the city, the Senate,
accompanied by the Bishop and all the clergy, secular
and regular, went in procession out of the city to Monte
di S. Sofia with all their relics, etc. There they
erected an altar in view of the burning mountain, and
celebrated mass, "and used the exorcismes accustomed
upon such extraordinary occasions, all which time the
mountain ceased not as before with excessive roaring
to throw up its smoak and flames with extraordinary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>violence, and abundance of great stones, which were
carried through the air."</li>

<li>For a few years after this terrible eruption Etna
was quiescent, but in 1682 a new mouth opened on the
east side of the mountain, a little below the summit,
and above the Val del Bove. Lava issued from it, and
rushed down the precipices of the Val del Bove as far
as the rock of Musarra.</li>

<li>Six years later a torrent of lava burst from an
opening in the great cone, and flowed into the Val del
Bove for a distance of three miles.</li>

<li>In the following year lava was emitted from a
mouth in the Val del Bove, and it descended for about
ten miles, destroying everything in its course, until it
reached a little valley near Macchia.</li>

<li>Early in January 1693, clouds of black smoke
were poured from the great crater, and loud noises
resembling the discharge of artillery were heard. A
violent earthquake succeeded, and Catania was shaken
to the ground, burying 18,000 of its inhabitants in the
ruins. It is said that in all fifty towns were destroyed
in Sicily, together with from 60,000 to 100,000 inhabitants.
Lava was emitted from the crater, which
was lowered by the eruption.</li>

<li>In the following year Etna again entered into
eruption, ejecting large quantities of ashes, some of
which were carried as far as Malta.</li>

<li><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>In March 1702, three mouths opened in the
Contrada del Trifoglietto, near the head of the Val del
Bove.  Lava was emitted from them, which flowed
into the Valley of Calanna.</li>

<li>Towards the end of 1723 loud bellowings issued
from the mountain; earthquakes occurred, and a torrent
of lava issued from the crater, which flowed towards
Bronte, through the Bosco di Bronte.</li>

<li>A small lava stream issued from the crater in
1732, and descended the western slope of the mountain,
but without producing any damage.</li>

<li>In October 1735, the usual noises which presage
an eruption were heard, earthquakes followed, and a
little later the crater emitted flames and red-hot stones.
Lava also issued from it, and the stream divided into
three branches, one of which flowed towards Bronte,
a second towards Linguaglossa, and a third towards
Mascali; but they did not get beyond the upper regions
of the mountain.</li>

<li>In 1744 the mountain threw out great quantities
of ashes, but no lava.</li>

<li>In 1747 a quantity of lava flowed from the great
crater into the Val del Bove, and the height of the
cone was considerably increased during the eruption.</li>

<li>Early in the year 1755, Etna began to show
signs of disturbance; a great column of black smoke
issued from the crater, from which forked lightning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>was frequently emitted. Loud detonations were heard,
and two streams of lava issued from the crater. A
new mouth opened near the Rocca di Musarra in the
Val del Bove, four miles from the summit, and a
quantity of lava was ejected from it. An extraordinary
flood of water descended from the Val del Bove, carrying
all before it, and strewing its path, with huge blocks.
Recupero estimated the volume of water as 16,000,000
cubic feet, probably a greater amount than could be
furnished by the melting of all the winter's snow on
the mountain. It formed a channel two miles broad,
and, in some places, thirty-four feet deep, and it
flowed at the rate of a mile in a minute and a half
during the first twelve miles of its course. Lyell considers
the flood was probably produced by the melting,
not only of the winter's snow, but also of older layers
of ice, which were suddenly melted by the permeation
of hot steam and lava, and which had been previously
preserved from melting by a deposit of sand and ashes,
as in the case of the ancient glacier found near the
summit of the mountain in 1828. In November 1758,
a smart shock of earthquake caused the cone of the
great crater to fall in, but no eruption occurred at the
time.</li>

<li>Great quantities of ashes, and some small streams
of lava, were emitted from the crater in 1759, a
little later the cone, which had been again raised by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>the eruption, gave way, and the greater part of it fell
into the crater. Two parts of it however were left
standing.</li>

<li>Severe shocks of earthquakes were felt on the
east side of the mountain in 1763, and a new mouth
opened in the Bosco di Bronte, ten miles from the town,
between Monte Rosso and Monte Lepre. Four other
mouths were afterwards opened in a line; they threw
up quantities of scori&aelig; and ashes, and afterwards lava.
In the middle of June several mouths opened on the
south side of the mountain, and a fissure 2000 feet long
opened downwards in a southerly direction. The lava
divided into two branches, the larger of which was ten
miles long and 250 feet wide, with a depth of 25
feet.</li>

<li>Several new mouths opened in the spring of
1766, and ejected large volumes of ashes, also streams
of lava, which flowed in the direction of Nicolosi and
Pedara.  The Canon Recupero, one of the historians
of Etna, witnessed this eruption, and narrowly escaped
being destroyed. He had ascended a small hill 50
feet high, of ancient volcanic matter, in order to
witness the approach of the lava stream which was
slowly advancing with a front of two miles and a half.
Suddenly two small streams detached themselves from
the main stream, and ran rapidly towards the hill.
Recupero and his guide at once hastened to descend,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>and had barely escaped when they saw the hill surrounded
by lava, and in a few minutes it was melted
down and sank into the molten mass.</li>

<li>In the early part of 1780, earthquakes were felt
all over Sicily, and on the 18th of May a fissure opened
on the south-west side of the mountain, and extended
from the base of the great crater for seven miles, terminating
in a new mouth from which a stream of lava
emanated. This encountered the cone of Palmintelli
in its course, and separated into two branches, each of
which was 400 feet wide. Other mouths opened later
in the year, and emitted large quantities of lava, which
devastated the country of Montemazzo.</li>

<li>In 1781 the volcano emitted a quantity of lava
which flowed into the Val del Bove. Clouds of grey
ashes were also ejected. At the commencement of the
great Calabrian earthquake of 1783, Etna ejected large
quantities of smoke, but it was otherwise quiescent.</li>

<li>In the middle of 1787 lava burst from the great
crater, which also discharged quantities of sand, scori&aelig;,
and red-hot ashes. Large heated masses of rock were
ejected to a great height, and subterranean bellowings
were heard by the dwellers on the mountain.</li>

<li>Five years afterwards a fresh outburst occurred,
earthquakes were prevalent, and vast volumes of smoke
bore to seaward, and seemed to bridge the sea between
Sicily and Africa. A torrent of lava flowed towards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>Aderno, and a second flowed into the Val del Bove
as far as Zoccolaro. A pit called <i>La Cisterna</i>, 40 feet
in diameter, opened in the Piano del Lago, near the
great cone, and ejected smoke and masses of old lava
saturated with water. Several mouths opened below
the crater, and the country round about Zaffarana was
desolated. The Abate Ferrara, the author of the
<i>Descrizione dell' Etna</i>, witnessed this eruption: "I
shall never forget," he writes, "that this last mouth
opened precisely on the spot where, the day before, I
had made my meal with a shepherd. On my return
next day he related how, after a stunning explosion,
the rocks on which we had sat together were blown
into the air, and a mouth opened, discharging a flood
of fire, which, rushing down with the rapidity of water,
hardly gave him time to make his escape."</li>

<li>In 1797 a slight eruption occurred, and the great
crater threw out ashes and sand, but no lava. Earthquakes
were frequent.</li>

<li>In the following year lava was emitted, and
severe earthquakes occurred.</li>

<li>The eruptions continued during 1799.</li>

<li>In February 1800 loud explosions were heard
by the dwellers on the mountain, and columns of fire
issued from the crater, accompanied by forked lightning.
This was succeeded by a discharge of hot ashes and
scori&aelig;, which, falling on the snows accumulated near
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>the summit of the mountain, produced devastating
floods of water.</li>

<li>In November 1802 a new mouth opened near
the Rocca di Musarra in the Val del Bove, which
emitted a copious stream of lava. In a day and a half
the lava had run twelve miles.</li>

<li>In 1805 the great crater was in a state of
eruption, and a cone was thrown up within it to a
height of 1,050 feet.</li>

<li>In 1808 the mountain again became active, and
fire and smoke were emitted from the crater.</li>

<li>In March 1809, no less than twenty-one mouths
of fire opened in the direction of Castiglione.  They
ejected volumes of smoke, large quantities of scori&aelig;
and ashes, and afterwards lava, which, uniting into one
torrent, flowed with a front of 450 feet for 8 miles.
Fissures were formed in the earth, and loud explosions
constantly occurred within the great crater; a small
cone was thrown up.</li>

<li>Two years afterwards more than thirty mouths
opened in a line running eastwards for five miles.
They ejected jets of fire accompanied by much smoke.
The eruptions soon diminished in the higher mouths,
and became more and more violent in the lower mouths,
until the eruption centred in the lowest one called S.
Simone, near the head of the Val del Bove. From this,
great black clouds, having a lustre like that of black
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>wool, issued, and afterwards quantities of lava, which
formed a stream a mile wide, and eight miles long. It
flowed nearly as far as the village of Milo. Frequent
earthquakes accompanied this outburst, and they continued
in various parts of the island for the following
five years.</li>

<li>In 1819 five new mouths of fire opened near the
scene of the eruption of 1811; three of these united
into one large crater, and poured forth a quantity of
lava into the Val del Bove. The lava flowed until it
reached a nearly perpendicular precipice at the bend
of the valley of Calanna, over which it fell in a cascade,
and, being hardened by its descent, it was forced against
the sides of the tufaceous rock at the bottom, so as to
produce an extraordinary amount of abrasion, accompanied
by clouds of dust, worn off by the friction. Mr.
Scrope observed that the lava flowed at the rate of
about a yard an hour, nine months after its emission.</li>

<li>A slight eruption occurred in 1831 from the great
crater, which threw out lava on its northern side.</li>

<li>In October of the following year a violent eruption
occurred.  A new crater was formed in the Val del
Serbo, above Bronte and three miles from the summit.
Seven mouths afterwards opened, three miles below the
first.  From one of these lava was emitted, which
flowed to within a mile and a half of Bronte. The
stream was a mile and a half broad, and 40 feet deep.</li>

<li><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
A slight eruption occurred in 1838, when a small
quantity of lava was poured from the great crater into
the Val del Bove.</li>

<li>Four years later the crater discharged ashes and
scori&aelig;, and lava burst from the cone 300 feet from the
summit. It flowed into the Val del Bove, in a stream
600 feet wide, and it came to a standstill ten miles from
the summit.</li>

<li>Near the end of the following year, fifteen mouths
of fire opened near the crater of 1832, at a height of
7000 feet above the sea. They began by discharging
scori&aelig; and sand, and afterwards lava, which divided into
three streams, the two outer ones soon came to a standstill,
while the central stream continued to flow at the
rapid rate of 180 feet a minute, the descent being an
angle of 25&deg;. The heat at a distance of 120 feet from
the current was 90&deg; F. A new crater opened just above
Bronte, and discharged lava which threatened the town,
but it fortunately encountered Monte Vittoria and was
diverted into another course. While a number of the
inhabitants of Bronte were watching the progress of the
lava, the front of the stream was suddenly blown out as
by an explosion of gunpowder; in an instant red-hot
masses were hurled in every direction; and a cloud of
vapour enveloped everything. Thirty-six persons were
killed on the spot, and twenty survived but a few hours.
The great crater showed signs of disturbance, by emitting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>dense volumes of smoke, and loud bellowings, also
quantities of volcanic dust saturated with hydrochloric
acid, which destroyed the vegetation wherever it fell.</li>

<li>A very violent eruption which lasted more than
nine months, commenced on the 21st of August, 1852.
It was first witnessed by a party of six English tourists,
who were ascending the mountain from Nicolosi in order
to see the sunrise from the summit. As they approached
the Casa Inglesi the crater commenced to give
forth ashes and flames of fire. In a narrow defile they
were met by a violent hurricane, which overthrew both
the mules and their riders, and urged them towards the
precipices of the Val del Bove. They sheltered themselves
beneath some masses of lava, when suddenly an
earthquake shook the mountain, and their mules in
terror fled away. They returned on foot towards daylight
to Nicolosi, fortunately without having sustained
injury. In the course of the night many <i>bocche del
fuoco</i> opened in that part of the Val del Bove called the
Balzo di Trifoglietto, and a great fissure opened at the
base of the Giannicola Grande, and a crater was thrown
up from which for seventeen days showers of sand and
scori&aelig; were ejected. During the next day a quantity of
lava flowed down the Val del Bove, branching off so
that one stream advanced to the foot of Monte Finocchio,
and the other to Monte Calanna. Afterwards it
flowed towards Zaffarana, and devastated a large tract
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>of woody region. Four days later a second crater was
formed near the first, from which lava was emitted
together with sand and scori&aelig;, which caused cones to
rise around the craters. The lava moved but slowly,
and towards the end of August it came to a stand, only
a quarter of a mile from Zaffarana: on the second of
September, Gemellaro ascended Monte Finocchio in the
Val del Bove in order to witness the outburst. He
states that the hill was violently agitated, like a ship at
sea. The surface of the Val del Bove appeared like a
molten lake; scori&aelig; were thrown up from the craters
to a great height, and loud explosions were heard at
frequent intervals. The eruption continued to increase in
violence. On October 6th two new mouths opened in the
Val del Bove, emitting lava which flowed towards the
Valley of Calanna, and fell over the Salto della Giumenta,
a precipice nearly 200 feet deep. The noise which
it produced was like that of the clash of metallic masses.
The eruption continued with abated violence during the
early months of 1853, and it did not finally cease till
May 27. The entire mass of lava ejected is estimated
to be equal to an area six miles long by two miles
broad, with an average depth of about twelve feet.<br /><br />

I am indebted to M. Antonin Moris of Palermo for
the following account of the eruption of 1852:<br /><br />

The eruption of 1852 commenced on the 21st of
August. The earthquakes, the jets of flame from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>great crater, and the subterranean rumblings which
usually precede an eruption, did not herald the approach
of this one. An English family, who were then making
the ascent of the mountain, together with a poor shepherd
of Riposto, were the only witnesses of the first
outburst. The latter was asleep in the midst of his
flocks, and was awakened by violent shakings of the
ground; he fled in haste, and some seconds afterwards
the earth opened with a loud noise, vomiting a terrible
column of fire, at the very spot which he had just
abandoned. An enormous crevasse opened on the north
side of Trifoglietto in the direction of the great crater.
On its summit near the opening called the Piccolo
Teatro, several openings were produced at the very first,
but they only emitted feeble currents of lava. All the
force of the eruption was concentrated at the foot of the
escarpment of the Serra di Giannicola, 4 kilometres,
(2&frac12; miles) from the summit of Etna. To the west of,
and somewhat above the principal crater, a second one
was formed, but its activity was of short duration. The
liquid lava issued with such violence that in 24 hours it
had reached the base of Monte Calanna, a distance of
3 kilometres, (nearly 2 miles). After surrounding this
hill, it divided into two currents, one of which ran
towards Zaffarana, and the other towards Milo. At a
distance they seemed to present a united front of 2
kilometres, (1&frac14; mile), which threatened to destroy all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>the villages below. The Val del Bove was already
entirely overrun; Isoletta dei Zappinelli in the midst
of the lavas of 1811 and 1819 was overwhelmed; the
valley of Calanna was buried under the fire with lava,
when on the 28th of August the lava hurled itself into
the narrow passage of the Portella di Calanna. A
frightful cascade of lava was then seen to precipitate
itself from a height of 60 metres, with a harsh metallic
noise, accompanied by loud cracking. Zaffarana was on
the eve of total ruin; the fire had taken the direction of
the ravine which terminates there, when suddenly, in
the beginning of September, the devastating stream
stayed its march against the ill-fated district.<br /><br />

On the contrary that which had taken the direction of
Milo, reinforced by a new current on the 10th of September,
destroyed the hamlet of Caselle del Milo; and
afterwards divided itself into two branches, which left
the village of Caselle in safety between them.<br /><br />

The inhabitants of La Macchia and Giarre gave themselves
up for lost; for it seemed that the lava would be
obliged to follow the valley of Santa Maria della Strada;
happily, however, from the 20th of September onward,
it ceased to advance perceptibly. The eruption did not
totally subside till March 1853; but the lava-flows did
no more than travel by the side, or on the top of the
older, without extending beyond them.<br /><br />

The crater of 1852 was called the Centenario, from its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>having been formed at the time of the centenary of the
f&ecirc;te of S. Agatha. Santiago, in the island of Cuba,
was destroyed by an earthquake on the very day of the
eruption.<br /><br />

During the whole period of the eruption, only one
explosion proceeded from the great crater of Etna. By
it an enormous column of ashes and scori&aelig; was cast into
the air.<br /><br />

On the 9th of September white ashes were seen on
the summit, which at a distance appeared like snow.
When pressed together by the hand they took the consistence
of clay, but they hardened in the fire, and could
then be reduced to powder. They have been considered
to be the <i>debris</i> of felspathic rocks, disintegrated by the
heat of the lava, and blown out by the expansive power
of disengaged gas.<br /><br />

The eruption of 1852 was one of the grandest of the
recorded eruptions of Etna. More than 2,000,000,000
cubic feet of red hot lava was spread over three square
miles. This eruption was minutely described by Carlo
Gemellaro, in a memoir entitled, "<i>Breve ragguaglio
della eruzione dell' Etna del 21 Agosto, 1852</i>."</li>

<li>In October 1864, frequent shocks of earthquakes
were felt by the dwellers on Etna. In January clouds
of smoke were emitted by the great crater, and roaring
sounds were heard. On the night of the 30th a violent
shock was felt on the north-east side of the mountain,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>and a mouth opened below Monte Frumento, from which
lava was ejected. It flowed at a rate of about a mile
a day, and ultimately divided into two streams. By
March 10th the new mouths of fire had increased to
seven in number, and they were all situated along a line
stretching down from the summit. The three upper
craters gave forth loud detonations three or four times a
minute. Professor Orazio Silvestri has devoted a quarto
of 267 pages to an account of <i>I Fenomeni Vulcanici
presentati dall' Etna nel 1863-64-65-66</i>.</li>

<li>In August 1874 the inhabitants of the towns
situated on the north, west, and east sides of the
mountain, were awakened by loud subterranean rumblings.
Soon afterwards a formidable column of black
smoke issued from the crater, accompanied by sand,
scori&aelig;, and ignited matter (<i>infuocata materia</i>). Severe
shocks of earthquake were felt, the centre of impulsion
being apparently situated on the northern flank of the
mountain, at a height of 2450 metres above the level
of the sea. Some small <i>bocche eruttive</i> opened near the
great crater, and ejected lava, but the quantity was
comparatively small, and but little damage was done.
An account of this eruption was given by Silvestri in
1874, in a small pamphlet entitled, <i>Notizie sulla eruzione
dell' Etna del 29 Agosto, 1874</i>. Since 1874 the mountain
has been in a quiescent state. The centre of disturbance
was at an elevation of 2450 metres (7600 feet)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>above the sea, on the north side of the crater, and
between the minor cones known as the <i>Fratelli Pii</i> and
<i>Monte Grigio</i>. A new crater, having an elliptical contour,
and a diameter of about 100 metres, was formed
at this point. It is composed of a prehistoric grey
labradorite, and of doleritic lava. Downwards from the
main crater, in the direction of Monte di Mojo, a long
fissure extended for 400 metres, and along the line of
this fissure no less than <i>thirty-five</i> minor cones opened,
with craters of from thirty to three metres in diameter.
The stream of lava ejected from the various <i>boccarelle</i>
was 400 metres long, 80 wide, and 2 metres in thickness,
and the bulk of volcanic material brought to the
surface, including the principal cone and its thirty-five
subordinates and their ejectamenta, was calculated to
amount to 1,351,000 cubic metres. The lava is of an
augitic character, and magnetic; it possesses a specific
gravity of 2&middot;3636 at 25&deg; C.</li></ol>

<p>It will be seen from the account of the foregoing
eruptions that there is a great similarity in the character
of the eruptions of Etna. Earthquakes presage the
outburst; loud explosions follow, rifts and <i>bocche del
fuoco</i> open in the sides of the mountain; smoke, sand,
ashes, and scori&aelig; are discharged, the action localises
itself in one or more craters, cinders are thrown up, and
accumulate around the crater and cone, ultimately lava
rises, and frequently breaks down one side of the cone,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>where the resistance is least. Then the eruption is at
an end.</p>

<p>Smyth says, "The symptoms which precede an eruption
are generally irregular clouds of smoke, ferilli, or
volcanic lightnings, hollow intonations, and local earthquakes
that often alarm the surrounding country as far
as Messina, and have given the whole province the name
of Val Demone, as being the abode of infernal spirits.
These agitations increase until the vast cauldron becomes
surcharged with the fused minerals, when, if the convulsion
is not sufficiently powerful to force them from
the great crater (which, from its great altitude and the
weight of the candent matter, requires an uncommon
effort), they explode through that part of the side which
offers the least resistance with a grand and terrific
effect, throwing red-hot stones and flakes of fire to an
incredible height, and spreading ignited cinders and
ashes in every direction." After the eruption of ashes,
lava frequently follows, sometimes rising to the top of
the cone of cinders, at others breaching it on the least
resisting side. When the lava has reached the base
of the cone, it begins to flow down the mountain, and
being then in a very fluid state, it moves with great
velocity. As it cools the sides and surface begin to
harden, its velocity decreases, and in the course of a
few days it only moves a few yards in an hour. The
internal portions, however, part slowly with their heat,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>and months after the eruption, clouds of steam arise from
the black and externally cold lava beds after rain, which,
having penetrated through the cracks, has found its way
to the heated mass within.</p>

<p>Of the seventy-eight eruptions described above, it will
be noticed that not more than nineteen have been of
extreme violence, while the majority have been of a
slight and comparatively harmless character.</p>

<p><br />The opinion of geologists is divided as to the manner
in which a volcano is first formed. Some hold that the
volcanic forces have upraised the rocks from beneath, and
at last finding vent have scattered the lighter portions
of such rocks into the air, and have poured out lava
through the rent masses, thus forming a <i>crater of
elevation</i>. Others maintain that the volcanic products
are ejected from an aperture or fissure already existing
in rocks previously formed, and that the accumulation of
these products around the vent forms the mass of the
volcano and the <i>crater of eruption</i>. Lyell favours the
latter view; Von Buch, Dufr&eacute;noy, and Elie de Beaumont
the former.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>According to M. Elie de Beaumont, Etna is an
irregular crater of elevation. The original deposits
were nearly horizontal, and lavas were poured through
fissures in these, and accumulated at first in layers;
afterwards the whole mass was upheaved and a crater
formed.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The upheaving force does not appear to have
acted at one point, but along a line traversing the Val
del Bove. The latter he refers to a subsidence of a
portion of the mountain. He divides the rocks of Etna
into six orders: 1. The lowest basis of the mountain
would appear to consist of granite, because masses of
that rock have from time to time been ejected. 2.
Calcareous and arenaceous rocks, of which the mountains
surrounding Etna are composed, and which appear
capped with lava near Bronte and elsewhere. 3. Basaltic
rocks, which are met with near Motta S. Anastasia,
Paterno, Licodia, and Aderno, and in the Isole
de'Ciclopi. 4. Rolled pebbles, which form a range of
slightly rising ground between the first slopes of Etna
on the southern side and the plain of Catania. (Lyell
speaks of this rising ground as consisting of "argillaceous
and sandy beds with marine shells, nearly all of living
Mediterranean species, and with associated and contemporaneous
volcanic rocks.") 5. Ancient lavas forming
the escarpments around the Val del Bove; and 6th,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>Modern lavas. He considers that the fissures which
abound on Etna are shifts or faults produced by dislocation,
and that the minor cones are points along such
fissures from which ashes and lava have been ejected.
He admits the existence of two cones. The geological
map of Etna prepared by M. Elie de Beaumont to
accompany his memoir can scarcely be regarded as a
great addition to our knowledge of the mountain. For
although in the main points it is correct, so many details
have been omitted that the map must be considered
to have now been quite superseded by those of Von
Waltershausen and Friedrich Hoffmann. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>The most convenient geological map of the mountain
is without doubt that of Hoffmann, given in the
<i>Vulkanen Atlas</i> of Dr. Von Leonhard; and here reproduced.
Von Waltershausen's geological map has been
the foundation of all others which have subsequently
appeared. It is a marvel of accurate work, and patient
industry. The form however is inconvenient, as it nowhere
appears as a whole, but in separate portions, which
are scattered through the folio sheets of the very expensive
<i>Atlas des Aetna</i>. It is accurate, and at the same
time very clear and intelligible. By reference to the
map it will be seen that from Capo di Schiso westward,
to near Paterno, Etna is surrounded by sandstone hills;
at the south we have recent clays, and, at intervals,
chalk. A large triangular space having the two angles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>at its base, respectively near Maletto and Aderno,
and its apex at the great crater, is covered with new
lava; while around Nicolosi there is volcanic sand. At
the Isole de'Ciclopi, Motta S. Anastasia, and a few
other places, basalt is seen; on each side of the Val del
Bove, dolerite; and near Misterbianco and Piedemonte,
small deposits of clay slate. The great mass of the
surface of the mountain, not specially mentioned above,
is volcanic tuff. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the more important and recent additions to our
knowledge of the geology of Etna may be mentioned
Lyell's paper on the subject, communicated to the Royal
Society in 1858, the matter of which is incorporated
in a lengthy chapter on Etna in the "Principles of
Geology." Lyell visited the mountain in 1828, 1857,
and 1858, and he then collected together a great
number of personal observations; he also made use
of the maps and plans of Von Waltershausen, and
he has analysed the views of Elie de Beaumont and
other writers. He alludes at the outset to the numerous
minor cones of Etna produced by lateral eruption, and
points out the fact that they are gradually obliterated by
the lava descending from the upper part of the mountain,
which flows around them and heightens the ground on
which they stand. In this way the crater of Monte
Nocilla is now level with the plain, and the crater of
Monte Capreolo was nearly filled by a lava stream in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>1669. Thus without doubt beneath the sloping sides
of Etna a multitude of obliterated monticules exist.</p>

<p>The strata which surround Mount Etna on the south
are of Newer Pliocene date, and contain shells which
are nearly all of species still living in the Mediterranean.
Out of sixty-five species collected by Lyell in 1828,
sixty-one were found to belong to species still common in
the Mediterranean. These strata are about the age of
the Norwich crag; and the oldest eruptions of Etna
must have taken place during the glacial period, but
before the period of greatest cold in Northern Europe.

</div>

<p>Before visiting Etna, Lyell had been told by Dr.
Buckland that in his opinion the Val del Bove was the
most interesting part of Etna, accordingly he specially
and minutely examined that part of the mountain.
This vast valley is situated on the eastern flanks of
the mountain, and it commences near the base of the
cone, stretching for nearly five miles downwards. It
is a large oval basin formed in the side of the
mountain, and surrounded by vast precipices, some of
which at the head of the valley are between three and
four thousand feet in height. The surface is covered
with lava of various dates, and several minor cones,
notably those of 1852, are within its boundaries. The
abrupt precipices reveal the presence of a large number
of vertical dikes, radiating from a point within the
valley, some of them, according to Von Waltershausen,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>being of ancient greenstone. Other dikes of
more modern doleritic lava radiate from the present
crater. From the slope of the beds in the Val del
Bove, Lyell and Von Waltershausen have independently
inferred that there was once a second great centre of
eruption in the Val del Bove between the Sierra
Giannicola, and Zoccolaro (<i>vide</i> the Figure on p.
<a href="#Page_117">117</a>). The axis of eruption passing through this
point Lyell calls the <i>Axis of Trifoglietto</i>; while he
distinguishes the present centre of eruption as the <i>Axis
of Mongibello</i>. These centres probably existed simultaneously,
but were unequal as regards eruptive violence;
the crater of Mongibello was the more active of the two,
and eventually overwhelmed the crater of Trifoglietto
with its products, by which means the whole mountain
became a fairly symmetrical cone, having the crater of
Mongibello at its apex (<i>vide</i> the Figures on pp. <a href="#Page_119">119</a> and
<a href="#Page_121">121</a>). Subsequently the Val del Bove was formed, probably
by some paroxysmal explosion, caused by pent-up
gases escaping from fissures. Possibly also subsidence
may have occurred.</p>

<p>We must then in the first place think of Etna as a
submarine volcano of the Newer Pliocene age; when it
reached the surface it increased rapidly in bulk by
pouring out scori&aelig; and lava from its two centres of
eruption&mdash;the centre of Mongibello, and the centre of
Trifoglietto,&mdash;general upheaval of the surrounding district
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>followed, and ultimately the crater of Trifoglietto was
obliterated by the discharges from the crater of Mongibello.
Afterwards the Val del Bove was blown out by
sudden eruptive force from beneath, and the mountain
assumed its present aspect. Then the historical eruptions
commenced, and of these we have given an account
in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>The most obvious method of obtaining some idea as
to the age of Etna, is to ascertain the thickness of
matter added during the historical period to the sides
of the mountain, and to compare this with the thickness
of the beds of ancient lava and scori&aelig; exposed at the
abrupt precipices of the Val del Bove. There is reason
for believing, however, that none of the ancient lavas
equalled in volume the lava streams of 1809 and 1852,
and the question is much complicated by other considerations.
Lyell compares the growth of a volcano
to that of an exogenous tree, which increases both in
bulk and height by the external application of ligneous
matter. Branches which shoot out from the trunk,
first pierce the bark and proceed outwards, but if they
die or are broken off they become inclosed in the body
of the tree, forming knots in the wood. Similarly the
volcano consists of a series of conical masses placed one
above the other, while the minor cones, corresponding
to the branches of the tree, first project, and then
become buried again, as successive layers of lava flow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>around them. But volcanic action is very intermittent,
the layers of lava and scori&aelig; do not accumulate evenly
and regularly like the layers of a tree. A violent
paroxysmal outbreak may be succeeded by centuries
of quiescence, or by a number of ordinary eruptions;
or, again, several paroxysmal outbreaks may occur in
succession. Moreover, each conical envelope of the
mountain is made up of a number of distinct currents
of lava, and showers of scori&aelig;. "Yet we cannot fail
to form the most exalted conception of the antiquity of
this mountain, when we consider that its base is about
90 miles in circumference; so that it would require ninety
flows of lava, each a mile in breadth at their termination,
to raise the present foot of the volcano as much as
the average height of one lava current." If all the
minor cones now visible on Etna could be removed, with
all the lava and scori&aelig; which have ever proceeded from
them, the mountain would appear scarcely perceptibly
smaller. Other cones would reveal themselves beneath
those now existing. Since the time when, in the Newer
Pliocene period, the foundations of Etna were laid in
the sea, it is quite impossible even to hint at the number
of hundreds of thousands of years which have elapsed.</p>

<p>We collected specimens of lava from various points
around and upon the mountain. They presented a
wonderful similarity of structure, and a mineralogist to
whom they were shown remarked that they might almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>all have come from the same crater, at the same time. A
specimen of the lava of 1535 found near Borello, was
ground by a lapidary until it was sufficiently transparent
to be examined under the microscope by polarised light.
It was found to contain good crystals of augite and
olivine, well striated labradorite, and titaniferous iron ore.</p>

<p>Elie de Beaumont affirms that the lavas of Etna
consist of labradorite, pyroxene (augite), peridot (olivine),
and titaniferous iron. Rose was the first to prove that
the lavas of Etna do not contain ordinary felspar
(or potash felspar), but labradorite (or lime felspar.)
(<i>Annales des Mines</i>, 3 serie, t. viii., p. 3.) Elie de
Beaumont detached a quantity of white crystals from the
interior of a lava found between Giarre and Aci Reale;
these were analysed by M. Auguste Laurent with the
following results in 100 parts:&mdash;</p>

<p>The minerals of Etna are not nearly as numerous
as those of Vesuvius. It has been remarked that no
area of equal size on the face of the globe furnishes
so many different species of minerals as Vesuvius and
its immediate neighbourhood. Out of the 380 species
of simple minerals enumerated by Hauy, no less than
82 had been found on and around Vesuvius, as long
ago as 1828, and many have been since found.</p>

<p>Of other common products of Etna, there are sulphur
in various forms, sulphurous acid gas, ammonia salts,
hydrochloric acid gas, and steam. A curious white
mass, which we found near the summit, proved to be
the result of the decomposition of lava by hot acid vapours.
In the different lavas, the crystals of labradorite, and of
olivine, vary in size considerably. Magnetic oxide of iron
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>is very visible in thin slices of the lavas when placed
under the microscope; and iron appears to be a constant
constituent in nearly all the products of the mountain.</p>

<p>Within the last few months Prof. Silvestri has
detected a mineral oil in the cavities of a prehistoric
doleritic lava found near Paterno.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The lava is in close
contiguity to the clay deposits of a mud volcano, and
when examined under the microscope is seen to consist
mainly of augite, together with olivine and transparent
crystals of labradorite. It contains numerous cavities
coated with arragonite, and filled with a mineral oil
which constitutes about one per cent of the whole weight
of the lava. It was taken from the lava at a temperature
of 24&deg; C., (75&middot;2&deg; F.), and solidified at 17&deg; C.
(62&middot;6&deg; F.) to a yellowish green mass, which on analysis

<p>An account of microscopic analysis of some of the
lavas of Etna, for which I am indebted to Mr. Frank
Rutley, will be found appended to this chapter. He
considers that they are Plagioclase-basalts, and occasionally
Olivine-basalts; and that they consist of Plagioclase,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>Augite, Olivine, Magnetite, Titaniferous iron, and
a residuum of glass.</p>

<p>Near the summit of the great crater I found a mass
of perfectly white, vesicular, and very friable substance,
somewhat pumiceous in appearance. It proved to be a
decomposed lava, and was found elsewhere on the sides
of the crater. Mr. Rutley examined a section of it,
and reports: "Under the microscope a tolerably thin
section shows the outlines of felspar crystals, lying
in a hazy milk-white semi-opaque granular matrix.
The felspar crystals are lighter and more translucent
than the matrix, but are of much the same character,
having a granulated or flocculent appearance, somewhat
like that of the decomposed felspars in diabase. There
are numerous roundish cavities in the section which may
once have contained olivine, or some other mineral, or
they may be merely vesicles."</p>

<p>A qualitative analysis of this substance, made by Mr.
H. M. Elder, has proved that it contains a large quantity
of Silica (about 70 per cent.), and smaller proportions
of Alumina, Iron, Magnesium, Calcium, and Potash;
together with very small amounts of Sulphuric Acid and
a trace of Ammonia. Lithium is absent, and Sodium is
only present in very minute quantity. Water is present
to the extent of nearly 20 per cent.</p>

<p>During the eruption of Etna in 1869 Von Waltershausen
noticed on some of the lava blocks which were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>still hot and smoking, silver-coloured particles, which
rapidly underwent change. An insufficient quantity for
analysis was collected, but during the eruption of 1874,
Silvestri found a quantity of the substance and analysed
it. (<i>Poggendorff's Annalen</i>, CLVII. 165, 1876.) It possesses
a specific gravity of 3&middot;147, and shows a metallic
lustre similar to that of steel. On analysis it was found
to consist of:&mdash;</p>

<p>which corresponds with the formula Fe<sub>5</sub>N<sub>2</sub>,&mdash;a formula
assigned by Fremy to Nitride of iron. It has been
named <i>Siderazote</i>. This new mineral species appears
to be formed by the action of hydrochloric acid,
and of ammonia on red-hot lava containing a large
percentage of iron. It was formed artificially by
exposing fragments of lava alternately to the action of
hydrochloric acid and ammonia in a red-hot tube. At a
high temperature Siderazote undergoes decomposition,
nitrogen being evolved. In contact with steam at a red
heat it forms magnetite and ammonia.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Mineral_Constitution_and_Microscopic_Characters" id="The_Mineral_Constitution_and_Microscopic_Characters"></a><small><i>The Mineral Constitution and Microscopic Characters<br />of some of the Lavas of Etna.</i></small></h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Frank Rutley, f.r.g.s.</span>, of <span class="smcap">H.M. Geological Survey.</span></p>


<p>A cursory examination of the series of specimens
collected by Mr. Rodwell, seemed to show that all the
lavas of Etna, irrespective of their differences in age,
exhibit a remarkable similarity in mineralogical constitution.
Occasionally, however, there appears to have
been a little difference in their respective viscidity at
the time of the eruption, the crystals in some of them
lying in all directions, while in others there appears to
be a more or less definite arrangement of the felspar
crystals, as seen in the lava of <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1689.</p>

<p>Although the specimens which I have examined
microscopically do not appear to differ in the nature
of their constituents, yet in some of them certain
minerals fluctuate in quantity, some containing a comparatively
large amount of olivine and well-developed
crystals of augite, while, in others, these minerals,
although one or other is always present, are but poorly
represented by minute and sparsely-disseminated grains.
It seems probable that all the Etna lavas contain traces
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>of a vitreous residuum, since, when sections are examined
under the microscope, a more or less general darkness
pervades their ground mass as soon as the Nicols are
crossed, and this general darkness does not appear to be
dissipated during the horizontal revolution of the sections
themselves. The translucent minerals in these sections
are all doubly refracting, and as I have not been able to
detect the presence of hauyne, noseau, sodalite, analcime,
or any other cubic mineral in them, the natural
inference is that the obscurity between crossed Nicols is
due to amorphous matter. I have only been able to
ascertain the presence of glass distinctly in a microscopic
section of the lava of Salto di Pulichello. In the other
sections which I have examined there appears to be a
small quantity of interstitial glass, but it is so finely disseminated
between the microliths of felspar and granules
of olivine, augite and magnetite, which constitute the
ground-mass of these rocks, that it is most difficult to
determine the single refraction of such minute specks
during revolution between crossed Nicols, and I therefore
merely express a belief, which, in some instances,
I cannot demonstrate with any certainty.</p>

<p class='caption'>Sections of Etna Lavas seen under the Microscope</p>
</div>

<p>Plagioclastic felspars are unquestionably the dominant
constituents of these lavas. Lyell, in his "Principles of
Geology," (9th Edition, p. 411), states that the felspar
is Labradorite. He does not, however, give the grounds
for this conclusion, and, as microscopic examination
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>alone merely indicates the crystalline system and not
the species of felspar, it is unsafe to speculate upon this
point in the absence of chemical investigation. In some
of these lavas Sanidine is also present, but it is always
subordinate to the plagioclase, and does not, as a rule,
appear to play a part sufficiently prominent to entitle
the rock to the appellation Trachy-dolerite.</p>

<p>Augite and olivine are generally present in the Etna
lavas, especially the latter mineral.</p>

<p>Magnetite appears to occur in all of them. Titaniferous
iron may also be represented, but I have failed
to detect any well-defined crystals, or any traces of the
characteristic white decomposition product which would
justify me in citing the presence of this mineral, although
it is stated by Lyell to occur in these rocks.</p>

<p>The constituent minerals of the Etna lavas now to be
described, namely, those of <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 396 and <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1535, 1603
and 1689, are:&mdash;</p>

<p>Plagioclase, augite, olivine, magnetite, and, in some
cases, sanidine&mdash;possibly titaniferous iron&mdash;and in some,
if not in all, a slight residuum of glass. These lavas
must therefore be regarded as plagioclase-basalts, or
occasionally as olivine-basalts. The plagioclase crystals
vary greatly in size, some being mere microliths while
others are over the eighth of an inch in length. They
show the characteristic twin lamellation by polarized
light, but the lamell&aelig; are often very irregular as regards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>their boundaries. The sections of the crystals themselves
are also frequently bounded by irregular outlines,
but they often show internally delicate zonal markings,
as indicated in Fig. <a href="#under_the_Microscope">1</a>,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> which correspond with the
outlines of perfectly developed crystals. The inclosures
in the larger plagioclastic felspars consist for the most
part either of brownish glass, containing fine dark
granular matter&mdash;probably magnetite, which often
renders them opaque,&mdash;or of matter similar to that
which constitutes the groundmass of the surrounding
rock. These stone and glass cavities are very numerous
and most irregular in outline, as shown in Figs. <a href="#under_the_Microscope">1</a> and
<a href="#under_the_Microscope">2</a>. They appear, however, to be elongated generally in
the direction of the planes of composition of the twin
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>lamell&aelig;. Zirkel has noted the plentiful occurrence of
these glass inclosures in the felspar crystals and
fragments of crystals which partly constitute the
volcanic sands of Etna, in which he has also detected
the presence of numerous isolated particles of brownish
glass.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The felspar microliths, which constitute so large
a proportion of the ground-mass in the Etna lavas, are
in most instances probably triclinic. Monoclinic felspar
does, however, occur in some of these rocks; but the
difficulty of ascertaining the precise character of microliths
renders it unsafe to speculate on the amount
of sanidine which may be present. Some crystals,
such as that shown in the centre of Fig. <a href="#under_the_Microscope">2</a>, appear at
first sight to be sanidine, twinned on the Carlsbad
type, but closer inspection often demonstrates the
presence of other and very delicate twin lamell&aelig;.</p>

<p>The augite in these lavas sometimes occurs in well-formed
crystals of a green or brown colour, and often
shows the characteristic cleavage very well, especially
in the augite crystals of the lava of the Boccarelle del
Fuoco, erupted in 1535. A small crystal of green
augite is represented at the bottom of Fig. <a href="#under_the_Microscope">1</a>. Augite,
however, appears to be more plentiful in the rocks in
the form of small roundish grains.</p>

<p>Olivine is of very common occurrence in the Etna
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>lavas, mostly in round or irregularly shaped grains, but
also in crystals which usually exhibit rounded angles.</p>

<p>A specimen of lava from Salto di Pulichello, erupted
in 1603, gave well-developed examples of the presence
of olivine, and also of plagioclase. The ground mass
was found to consist of felspar microliths, and grains of
olivine, augite, and magnetite, with some interstitial
glass.</p>

<p>Magnetite is present in all of the lavas here described.
It occurs both in octahedral crystals and in the form
of irregular grains and fine dust. To the presence of
this substance much of the opacity of thin sections of
the Etna lavas is due.</p>

<p>Titaniferous iron may also be present. One small
crystal in the lava of 1535 appeared to show a somewhat
characteristic form, but although much of the
black opaque matter has undergone decomposition, I
have failed to detect any of the white or greyish alteration
product which characterises titaniferous iron, and in
the absence of this, of definite crystalline form, and of
chemical analysis, it seems better to speak of this mineral
with reserve, although titanium is very probably present,
since much magnetite is known to be titaniferous.</p>

<p>The vitreous matter which occurs in these lavas is
principally present in the form of inclosures in the
felspar, and, sometimes, the augite and olivine crystals
previously described. Its occurrence in the groundmass
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>of these rocks has also been alluded to. In this interstitial
condition its amount is usually very small&mdash;a fact
already pointed out by Zirkel.</p>

<p>I have unfortunately had no opportunity of examining
the volcanic sands and ashes of Etna, but Zirkel's
description of them seems to indicate their close mineralogical
relation to lavas erupted in this district, with one
exception, as pointed out by Rosenbusch,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> namely,
that he makes no mention of the occurrence of olivine in
these ejectamenta.</p>

<p>Reference to the Figures <a href="#under_the_Microscope">1</a> and <a href="#under_the_Microscope">2</a> will suffice to show
how close a relationship in mineral constitution exists
between these two lavas, separated in the dates of their
eruption by an interval of over two thousand years.</p>

<p><i>New Maps of Etna.</i>&mdash;After these pages had received
their final revision in type, I met with two new maps of
Etna in the Paris Exhibition. The literature of our
subject will obviously be incomplete without some notice
of them, although this belongs properly to the first chapter
rather than to the last. The one is a map in relief
constructed by Captain Francesco Pistoja for the <i>Istituto</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span><i>Topografico Militare</i> of Florence. The vertical scale is
1/25,000 and the horizontal is 1/50,000. The surface is coloured
geologically: the lavas erupted during each century
being differently coloured, while the course of each stream
is traced. This map, although by no means free from
errors, is a vast improvement on the relief map of M.
Elie de Beaumont. One defect, which might be easily
remedied, is due to the fact that the lavas of three consecutive
centuries are coloured so much alike, that it is
almost impossible to distinguish them. The minor cones
are well shown, the Val del Bove fairly well, and the
map is altogether a valuable addition to our knowledge of
the mountain.</p>

<p>The other map is a <i>Carta Agronomica dell' Etna</i>,
showing the surface cultivation. Different colours
denote different plants, pistachio nuts, vines, olives,
chestnuts, etc. It is beautifully drawn and coloured by
hand, and is the work of Signor L. Ardini, of Catania.</p>

<div class="note"><h3>TRANSCRIBERS NOTES:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Some arcane spellings retained where verified as correct for the time of publication or quote, such
as 'musquitoes', 'plaintain', 'mettals', 'felspar', etc.</li>
<li>Italian quotations sometimes include phrases such as "sull' Etna" or "dell' Asia". There
should be no space after the apostrophes but spaces are often present. This may have
been done to better space the text during justification. Such errors have not been
corrected.</li>
<li>The document is inconsistent in the use of commas where quoting numbers of over 1,000;
sometimes they are used and sometimes they are not used. These inconsistencies remain.</li>
<li>Addition of full-stops where omitted within text outlining chapter highlights; page ix after 'Silvestri',
page x after 'Eruptions' and '1408', page xi after 'microscope', page 79 after '812'.</li>
<li>Corrected 'ength' to 'length' on page 4.</li>
<li>Corrected 't'jncedie' to 't'incedie' on page 12; its leading e has a tilde symbol over it but this has been omitted.
Similarly, treblement has been transcribed without a tilde symbol over its leading e.</li>
<li>Transcribed 'Guiseppe' as 'Giuseppe' on pages 17 and 144 since this is a more usual form.</li>
<li>Added missing endquotes to quotation by Professor Jukes on page 27.</li>
<li>Inserted full-stop after '(S.W.)', page 29, to end sentence.</li>
<li>Corrected 'f' to 'of' on final line of page 33.</li>
<li>Corrected 'of-course' to 'of course', page 42.</li>
<li>Corrected 'unusally' to 'unusually', page 44.</li>
<li>Corrected 'subsequenly' to 'subsequently', page 59.</li>
<li>Corrected 'athough' to 'although', page 64.</li>
<li>Numbered list of eruptions repeats item 5, then jumps to seven on page 82. Corrected to numeric order.</li>
<li>'In the 1329' corrected to 'In the year 1329', page 85.</li>
<li>'the time analcite' corrected to 'the term analcite', page 127.</li>
<li>Corrected 'magnitite' to 'magnetite', page 140.</li>
